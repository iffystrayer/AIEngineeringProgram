## 1. Mocks, Stubs, and Placeholders Inventory

### 1.1 Test Mocks (EXPECTED - Keep for Testing)

**Location:** `tests/` directory
**Purpose:** Unit testing isolation
**Status:** ‚úÖ **Appropriate** - These should remain as mocks

| File | Mock Type | Purpose |
|------|-----------|---------|
| `tests/agents/test_response_quality_agent.py` | LLM Router Mock | Test agent logic without API calls |
| `tests/agents/test_stage_gate_validator_agent.py` | LLM Router Mock | Test validation logic in isolation |
| `tests/agents/test_consistency_checker_agent.py` | LLM Router Mock | Test consistency checking logic |
| `tests/export/test_charter_generator.py` | Citation Formatter Mock | Test export without full formatter |

**Verdict:** ‚úÖ **Keep** - Proper use of mocks for unit testing

### 1.2 Agent Implementation Stubs

#### ‚ö†Ô∏è Stage Interview Agents - PARTIAL IMPLEMENTATIONS

**Files:**
- `src/agents/stage1_business_translation.py` (855 lines)
- `src/agents/stage2_agent.py` (757 lines)
- `src/agents/stage3_agent.py` (762 lines)
- `src/agents/stage4_agent.py` (763 lines)
- `src/agents/stage5_agent.py` (714 lines)

**Current Status:**
- ‚úÖ **Structure defined:** Class hierarchies, method signatures
- ‚úÖ **Prompts defined:** System prompts, question templates
- ‚ùå **Not integrated:** Not connected to LLM router
- ‚ùå **No conversation loop:** Placeholder `conduct_interview()` methods
- ‚ùå **No data extraction:** Placeholder deliverable generation

**Example Placeholder** (`stage1_business_translation.py:500-510`):
```python
async def conduct_interview(self, session: Session) -> ProblemStatement:
    """
    Conduct Stage 1 interview (PLACEHOLDER).

    TODO: Implement actual conversation loop with LLM integration
    """
    raise NotImplementedError("Interview logic pending LLM integration")
```

**Priority:** üî¥ **HIGH** - Core functionality missing

#### ‚úÖ Reflection Agents - FULLY IMPLEMENTED

**Files:**
- `src/agents/reflection/response_quality_agent.py` (294 lines) - **COMPLETE**
- `src/agents/reflection/stage_gate_validator_agent.py` (411 lines) - **COMPLETE**
- `src/agents/reflection/consistency_checker_agent.py` (384 lines) - **COMPLETE**

**Status:**
- ‚úÖ Fully implemented with LLM integration
- ‚úÖ 95/95 tests passing (100%)
- ‚úÖ Integrated into Orchestrator
- ‚úÖ Production-ready

**Verdict:** ‚úÖ **Complete** - No placeholders

### 1.3 Orchestrator Integration Gaps

**File:** `src/agents/orchestrator.py` (737 lines)

**Implemented:**
- ‚úÖ Reflection agent integration (fully functional)
- ‚úÖ Quality loop management
- ‚úÖ Stage gate validation
- ‚úÖ Consistency checking

**Placeholders:**
- ‚ùå `conduct_full_protocol()` - Not implemented
- ‚ùå `conduct_stage()` - Placeholder implementation
- ‚ùå Conversation state management - Partial
- ‚ùå LLM router initialization - Placeholder

**Example Placeholder** (`orchestrator.py:220-230`):
```python
async def conduct_full_protocol(self, session: Session) -> AIProjectCharter:
    """
    Conduct complete 5-stage U-AIP protocol (PLACEHOLDER).

    TODO: Implement stage sequencing and conversation orchestration
    """
    raise NotImplementedError("Full protocol orchestration pending")
```

**Priority:** üî¥ **HIGH** - Required for end-to-end workflow

### 1.4 CLI Implementation Gaps

**File:** `src/cli/main.py` (834 lines)

**Implemented:**
- ‚úÖ Session management (start, resume, list, delete)
- ‚úÖ Database integration
- ‚úÖ Charter export command (**NEW**)
- ‚úÖ Status display
- ‚úÖ Rich formatting

**Placeholders:**
- ‚ùå Agent conversation loop in `start`/`resume` commands
- ‚ùå Interactive Q&A workflow
- ‚ùå Progress indicators during stages
- ‚ùå Real-time reflection feedback to user

**Example** (`main.py:219-228`):
```python
console.print("\n[cyan]Next Steps:[/cyan]")
console.print("  1. [dim]Initialize Stage 1 (Business Translation) Agent[/dim] "
              "[yellow]‚Üí Coming in Phase 2[/yellow]")
console.print("  2. [dim]Begin interactive conversation[/dim] "
              "[yellow]‚Üí Coming in Phase 2[/yellow]")
```

**Priority:** üü° **MEDIUM** - Depends on agent implementation

### 1.5 Database Repository Simplifications

**File:** `src/database/repositories/charter_repository.py` (364 lines)

**Current Implementation:**
- ‚úÖ CRUD operations functional
- ‚úÖ Basic serialization working
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Simplified charter serialization** (lines 326-364)

**Placeholder:**
```python
def _charter_to_dict(self, charter: AIProjectCharter) -> dict:
    """Convert AIProjectCharter to JSON-serializable dict."""
    # Simple implementation - convert dataclass to dict
    # In production, use dataclasses.asdict() or custom serialization
    return {
        "session_id": str(charter.session_id),
        "project_name": charter.project_name,
        # ... simplified - in production, serialize full stage deliverables
    }
```

**Issue:** Full stage deliverable serialization is commented as "simplified"

**Priority:** üü¢ **LOW** - Works for current needs; improve when needed

### 1.6 LLM Router Configuration

**File:** `src/llm/router.py` (341 lines)

**Status:**
- ‚úÖ Structure complete
- ‚úÖ Provider routing logic implemented
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **API key management** - Uses environment variables (expected)
- ‚úÖ Error handling implemented

**Potential Issue:** May need actual API keys for full testing

**Priority:** üü¢ **LOW** - Expected pattern for API integration

## 4. Comparison with Original Plan

### Original Project Phases (from SWE Spec)

#### Phase 1: Foundation (Weeks 1-4) - **COMPLETE ‚úÖ**
- ‚úÖ Data models and schemas
- ‚úÖ Database schema and migrations
- ‚úÖ Session management
- ‚úÖ LLM router infrastructure

**Status:** 100% Complete

#### Phase 2: Agent Development (Weeks 5-10) - **PARTIAL ‚ö†Ô∏è**

**Original Plan:**
- Weeks 5-6: Stage 1-2 agents
- Weeks 7-8: Stage 3-4 agents
- Weeks 9-10: Stage 5 agent + reflection agents

**Current Status:**
- ‚úÖ **COMPLETE:** Reflection agents (3/3)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **PARTIAL:** Stage agents (structure only, no conversations)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **AHEAD:** Reflection agents completed before stage agents

**Variance:** Implemented reflection agents first (good decision - enables TDD for stage agents)

#### Phase 3: Conversation Engine (Weeks 11-12) - **NOT STARTED ‚ùå**

**Original Plan:**
- Conversation state machine
- Turn-taking logic
- Context management
- Response parsing

**Current Status:** Not started - this is the main gap

#### Phase 4: Integration (Weeks 13-14) - **PARTIAL ‚ö†Ô∏è**

**Original Plan:**
- End-to-end workflow
- CLI integration
- Testing

**Current Status:**
- ‚úÖ CLI commands implemented
- ‚úÖ Database integration complete
- ‚úÖ Charter export complete (AHEAD OF SCHEDULE)
- ‚ùå Conversation loop missing

**Variance:** Infrastructure ahead of schedule, but missing conversation engine

### Timeline Comparison

| Phase | Planned | Actual | Variance |
|-------|---------|--------|----------|
| Foundation | Weeks 1-4 | Weeks 1-4 | ‚úÖ On Schedule |
| Agent Dev | Weeks 5-10 | Weeks 5-7 (partial) | ‚ö†Ô∏è Behind, but reflection agents ahead |
| Conversation Engine | Weeks 11-12 | Not started | üî¥ Critical Gap |
| Integration | Weeks 13-14 | Week 8 (partial) | ‚úÖ Infrastructure ahead, conversation behind |
| Charter Export | Week 14 | Week 4 | ‚úÖ **AHEAD** (completed early) |

### Key Achievements vs. Plan

**Ahead of Schedule:**
1. ‚úÖ Reflection agents (100% complete with TDD)
2. ‚úÖ Charter export (all 3 formats implemented)
3. ‚úÖ CLI integration (polished, production-ready)
4. ‚úÖ Database infrastructure (comprehensive, tested)

**Behind Schedule:**
1. ‚ùå Conversation engine (core gap)
2. ‚ùå Stage agent LLM integration (structure only)
3. ‚ùå End-to-end workflow (missing conversation loop)

### Strategic Assessment

**Positive Variance:**
- Strong foundation enables rapid feature development
- Reflection agents completed first = better quality assurance
- Charter export early = earlier user value

**Negative Variance:**
- Conversation engine is critical path blocker
- Stage agents need LLM integration to be useful

**Recommendation:** Prioritize conversation engine and stage agent integration in next sprint
