## ðŸŽ¯ PHASE 1: CRITICAL BLOCKERS (2-3 Days)

### Overview
12 atomic tasks organized into 4 blockers:

1. **Blocker 1: Wire Orchestrator to Database** (4 tasks, 6-9 hours)
   - Task 1.1: Agent Registry Initialization
   - Task 1.2: Session Persistence
   - Task 1.3: Session Resume

2. **Blocker 2: Integrate Reflection Agents** (3 tasks, 6-9 hours)
   - Task 2.1: ResponseQualityAgent
   - Task 2.2: StageGateValidatorAgent
   - Task 2.3: ConsistencyCheckerAgent

3. **Blocker 3: Complete Charter Generation** (2 tasks, 5-7 hours)
   - Task 3.1: Charter Data Aggregation
   - Task 3.2: Governance Decision Logic

4. **Blocker 4: Fix CLI Commands** (4 tasks, 4-6 hours)
   - Task 4.1: Resume Command
   - Task 4.2: List Command
   - Task 4.3: Delete Command
   - Task 4.4: Status Command

### Execution Strategy

**Day 1: Blockers 1 & 2**
- Morning: Tasks 1.1-1.3 (Orchestrator + Database)
- Afternoon: Tasks 2.1-2.3 (Reflection Agents)
- Evening: Regression testing

**Day 2: Blockers 3 & 4**
- Morning: Tasks 3.1-3.2 (Charter Generation)
- Afternoon: Tasks 4.1-4.4 (CLI Commands)
- Evening: Full regression testing

**Day 3: Stabilization**
- Fix any failing tests
- Verify SWE spec compliance (80%+)
- Performance testing
- Documentation updates

### TDD Workflow for Each Task

```
1. Write failing test (RED)
   - Define expected behavior
   - Use mocks for dependencies
   - Test both happy path and error cases

2. Implement minimum code (GREEN)
   - Make test pass
   - Don't over-engineer
   - Focus on correctness

3. Refactor (REFACTOR)
   - Improve code quality
   - Extract common patterns
   - Add error handling

4. Regression check (VERIFY)
   - Run full test suite
   - Check for breakage
   - Verify SWE spec compliance
```

### Quality Gates

**Before committing each task:**
```bash
# 1. Run task-specific tests
pytest tests/test_orchestrator.py::test_specific_task -v

# 2. Run related integration tests
pytest tests/integration/ -v

# 3. Run full test suite
pytest tests/ -v --tb=short

# 4. Check code coverage
pytest tests/ --cov=src --cov-report=term-missing

# 5. Verify SWE spec compliance
# (Manual checklist against SWE_SPECIFICATION.md)
```

## ðŸš¨ RISK MITIGATION

### Phase 1 Risks
- **Risk:** Tests too complex, slow development
  - **Mitigation:** Start with simple tests, iterate
- **Risk:** Regression in existing functionality
  - **Mitigation:** Run full test suite after each task
- **Risk:** SWE spec drift

### Phase 2 Risks
- **Risk:** Frontend complexity delays delivery
  - **Mitigation:** Use component library, focus on MVP
- **Risk:** API design doesn't match frontend needs
  - **Mitigation:** Design API with frontend team
- **Risk:** Performance issues with large charters
  - **Mitigation:** Implement pagination, lazy loading
