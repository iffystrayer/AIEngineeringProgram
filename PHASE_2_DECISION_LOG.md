# Phase 2 Implementation - Decision Log

**Project:** U-AIP Scoping Assistant v1.0
**Phase:** Phase 2 - Agent Implementation
**Created:** 2025-10-13
**Purpose:** Track key architectural and sequencing decisions for Phase 2 development

## Decision Record

### Decision #1: Follow Critical Path - Stage 1 Agent First

**Date:** 2025-10-13
**Decision Maker:** Project Team
**Status:** ✅ APPROVED

#### Context

Phase 2 has 42 tasks across 4 categories:
- Orchestrator Agent: 6 tasks (2 complete, 4 remaining)
- Stage Agents: 20 tasks (5 agents × 4 tasks each)
- Reflection Agents: 12 tasks (3 agents × 4 tasks each)
- Integration & Tools: 4 tasks

Current state:
- ✅ ORC-1: Orchestrator TDD tests complete
- ✅ ORC-2: Orchestrator core implementation complete (38/51 tests passing)
- 12 failing tests require reflection agents and advanced features
- No stage agents implemented yet

#### Options Considered

**Option 1: Critical Path - Start Stage 1 Agent (SELECTED)**
- Rationale: Stage 1 blocks all downstream stages (S2-S5)
- Sequence: S1-1 → S1-2 → S1-3 → S1-4
- Benefits:
  - Unblocks all other stage agents
  - Establishes pattern for remaining stage agents
  - Can parallelize S2-S5 after S1 complete
  - Gets end-to-end conversation flow working earliest
- Risks:
  - Some orchestrator tests will remain failing temporarily
  - Need to mock reflection agents for S1 initially

**Option 2: Complete Orchestrator First**
- Sequence: ORC-3 → ORC-4 → ORC-5 → ORC-6
- Benefits: All orchestrator tests passing
- Drawbacks:
  - Still can't test end-to-end without stage agents
  - ORC-5/ORC-6 need stage agents anyway
  - Delays unblocking parallel work

**Option 3: Start Reflection Agents First**
- Sequence: REF-1-1 → REF-1-2 → REF-2-1 → REF-2-2
- Benefits: Fixes failing orchestrator tests
- Drawbacks:
  - Can't properly test reflection agents without stage agents
  - Delays getting conversation flow working
  - Creates artificial test passes without real integration

#### Decision

**SELECTED: Option 1 - Critical Path (Stage 1 Agent First)**

#### Rationale

1. **Dependency Chain:** Stage 1 is the critical path blocker
   - S1 blocks S2, S3, S4, S5 (sequential stage dependencies)
   - Reflection agents need stage agents to test against
   - Integration tests need complete stage flow

2. **Parallelization Strategy:**
   - After S1 complete: Can work on S2, S3, S4, S5 in parallel
   - After any stage complete: Can work on reflection agents
   - Maximizes team velocity after initial S1 investment

3. **Value Delivery:**
   - Gets end-to-end conversation working fastest
   - Establishes pattern for remaining 4 stage agents
   - Enables early user testing with single-stage flow

4. **Risk Mitigation:**
   - Stage 1 is simplest stage (good learning opportunity)
   - Can mock reflection agents temporarily
   - Validates architecture before scaling to 5 stages

#### Implementation Sequence

**Phase 2A: Stage 1 Agent (Current Sprint)**
```
S1-1: Stage 1 TDD Specification Tests (45 min)
  ↓
S1-2: Stage 1 Agent Implementation (90 min)
  ↓
S1-3: Stage 1 Validation Logic (45 min)
  ↓
S1-4: Stage 1 Claude API Integration (45 min)
```
**Estimated Total:** 3.75 hours

**Phase 2B: Parallel Stage Development (Next Sprint)**
```
After S1-4 complete, parallelize:
- Stream 1: S2-1 → S2-2 → S2-3 → S2-4
- Stream 2: S3-1 → S3-2 → S3-3 → S3-4
- Stream 3: S4-1 → S4-2 → S4-3 → S4-4
- Stream 4: S5-1 → S5-2 → S5-3 → S5-4
- Stream 5: REF-1-1 → REF-1-2 (after S1-2 available for testing)
```

**Phase 2C: Integration & Completion**
```
After all stage agents complete:
- REF-2-1 → REF-2-2 → REF-2-4 (Stage Gate Validator)
- REF-3-1 → REF-3-2 → REF-3-4 (Consistency Checker)
- INT-1 → INT-2, INT-3 (Tool System)
- ORC-3, ORC-4, ORC-5, ORC-6 (Complete Orchestrator)
- INT-4 (End-to-End Integration Tests)
```

#### Success Metrics

- [ ] S1 agent can conduct full Stage 1 interview
- [ ] S1 agent generates valid ProblemStatement object
- [ ] S1 agent integrates with Orchestrator
- [ ] S1 pattern documented for reuse in S2-S5
- [ ] All S1 tests passing (unit + integration)

#### Notes

- Follow strict TDD methodology (tests first, always)
- Mock reflection agents initially in S1
- Document learnings from S1 for S2-S5 implementation
- Run quality gates before each commit
- Update PHASE_2_TASK_LIST.md as tasks complete
