## The 5-Stage Interview Process

### Stage 1: Problem Definition (12 Questions)

**Purpose**: Translate your business need into a precise AI problem statement

**Question Groups:**

#### Group 1: Core Business Objective (3 questions)
- What business problem are you trying to solve?
- Why is this problem important to the organization?
- What would success look like? How will you measure it?

**Example Response:**
```
Problem: We're losing 20% of customers annually, costing $2M in revenue.
Importance: Customer retention is cheaper than acquisition (5x cost difference).
Success: Reduce churn from 20% to 5% within 6 months, measured by monthly retention rate.
```

**Quality Indicators:**
- ✅ Specific metrics mentioned (20%, $2M)
- ✅ Clear business impact (revenue loss)
- ✅ Measurable success criteria (5% target)

**Common Mistakes:**
- ❌ Vague objectives ("improve customer satisfaction")
- ❌ No metrics ("reduce churn")
- ❌ Overly broad scope ("fix all customer issues")

#### Group 2: AI Suitability Assessment (3 questions)
- Have you considered non-AI solutions? What were they?
- Why is AI/ML necessary for solving this problem?
- What makes this problem suitable for machine learning?

**Example Response:**
```
Non-AI solutions: Rule-based segmentation, manual outreach campaigns.
Why AI: Too many variables (100+ features) for manual rules. Patterns too complex.
ML Suitability: Historical data shows patterns. Binary outcome (churn/retain).
Large dataset (50K customers, 2 years history).
```

**Quality Indicators:**
- ✅ Considered alternatives
- ✅ Clear AI necessity justification
- ✅ Pattern recognition mentioned
- ✅ Data availability confirmed

#### Group 3: Problem Definition (3 questions)
- What input data/features will the model use to make predictions?
- What should the model predict or output?
- What type of ML task is this?

**Example Response:**
```
Inputs: Customer demographics (age, location), purchase history (frequency, value,
recency), engagement metrics (login frequency, support tickets, feature usage).

Output: Binary prediction - Will customer churn in next 30 days? (Yes/No)

Task Type: Binary classification
```

**ML Archetype Detection:**
The system automatically determines your ML archetype:
- **Classification**: Categorical outputs (Yes/No, Category A/B/C)
- **Regression**: Continuous numeric outputs ($1000, 75%)
- **Time Series**: Temporal forecasting (next month sales)
- **Anomaly Detection**: Unusual pattern identification (fraud)
- **Clustering**: Grouping without labels (customer segments)
- **NLP**: Text processing (sentiment analysis, classification)
- **Computer Vision**: Image/video analysis
- **Recommendation**: Item suggestions

#### Group 4: Scope & Boundaries (3 questions)
- What will this project NOT do? What's explicitly out of scope?
- What are the constraints? (time, budget, resources, regulations)
- What edge cases or special scenarios should be excluded?

**Example Response:**
```
Out of Scope:
- New customers (< 3 months tenure)
- B2B enterprise customers (different churn patterns)
- Predicting WHY customers churn (just IF they will)

Constraints:
- Must comply with GDPR (EU customers)
- Budget: $100K for first phase
- Timeline: 6 months to production
- Must integrate with existing CRM (Salesforce)

Edge Cases to Exclude:
- Customers in bankruptcy proceedings
- Seasonal businesses with cyclical patterns
- Customers flagged for fraud
```

**Stage 1 Deliverable**: `ProblemStatement`
- Business objective
- AI necessity justification
- Input features list
- Target output definition
- ML archetype classification
- Scope boundaries
- Feature availability report

---

### Stage 2: Success Criteria (8-10 Questions)

**Purpose**: Define measurable business KPIs and ML metrics, ensuring alignment

**Key Questions:**

1. **Business KPIs** (3-4 questions)
   - What business metric will this AI system improve?
   - What's the current baseline value?
   - What's your target value?
   - How frequently will you measure this?

**Example Response:**
```
Business KPI: Customer Churn Rate
Current Value: 20% monthly churn
Target Value: 5% monthly churn (15 percentage point reduction)
Measurement: Calculated monthly from CRM data
Timeline: Achieve target within 6 months
```

2. **ML Performance Metrics** (3-4 questions)
   - What ML metrics are most important for your use case?
   - What's an acceptable range for precision?
   - What's an acceptable range for recall?
   - Should the model optimize for precision or recall?

**Example Response:**
```
Primary Metric: Precision (minimize false positives)
Target Precision: 85% (we act on predictions, want high confidence)
Minimum Recall: 60% (okay to miss some, but catch majority)
Optimization: Prioritize precision - false positives waste retention budget
```

**Common ML Metrics by Archetype:**

| ML Archetype | Primary Metrics | Secondary Metrics |
|--------------|----------------|-------------------|
| Classification | Precision, Recall, F1-Score | AUC-ROC, Accuracy |
| Regression | RMSE, MAE | R², MAPE |
| Time Series | MAPE, RMSE | MAD, Forecast Bias |
| Anomaly Detection | Precision, Recall | False Positive Rate |
| Clustering | Silhouette Score | Davies-Bouldin Index |
| NLP | F1-Score, BLEU | Perplexity, ROUGE |
| Computer Vision | mAP, IoU | Precision, Recall |
| Recommendation | Precision@K, Recall@K | NDCG, MRR |

3. **Metric Alignment** (2 questions)
   - How do ML metrics connect to business KPIs?
   - What trade-offs are acceptable?

**Example Response:**
```
Alignment:
- High precision → fewer wasted retention offers → lower cost
- High recall → catch more at-risk customers → lower churn
- Trade-off: We accept 60% recall because our retention budget is limited.
  Better to be confident (85% precision) on smaller group than
  waste money on false positives.

Business Impact:
- 85% precision = 85% of targeted customers actually at risk
- 60% recall = we catch 60% of churners (vs 0% without AI)
- Expected outcome: Reduce churn from 20% to 8-10% (vs target of 5%)
```

**Stage 2 Deliverable**: `MetricAlignmentMatrix`
- List of business KPIs with targets
- List of ML metrics with thresholds
- Explicit mapping between business and ML metrics
- Trade-off documentation

### Stage 3: Data Assessment (10-12 Questions)

**Purpose**: Evaluate data quality, availability, and readiness for ML

**Question Categories:**

#### 3.1 Data Availability (3 questions)
- What data exists today for this problem?
- How much historical data is available?
- Is this data accessible in production/real-time?

**Example Response:**
```
Available Data:
- Customer profiles: 50,000 records, 2 years history
- Transaction logs: 500,000 transactions, complete history
- Support tickets: 10,000 tickets, 18 months
- Engagement events: 2M events, real-time stream

Historical Depth: 2 years for most features
Accessibility:
- Profiles: Batch (nightly sync from CRM)
- Transactions: Real-time (Kafka stream)
- Tickets: Batch (weekly export)
- Events: Real-time (Analytics API)
```

#### 3.2 Data Quality Dimensions (6 questions)

The system evaluates 6 critical dimensions:

**1. Completeness**
- Question: What percentage of records have all required features?
- Target: >90% completeness
- Example: "95% of customers have all core features. 5% missing recent engagement data."

**2. Accuracy**
- Question: How accurate is the data? Any known quality issues?
- Example: "Transaction amounts verified by accounting. Engagement events have ~5% duplicate rate due to tracking bugs."

**3. Consistency**
- Question: Is data consistent across systems?
- Example: "Customer IDs match across CRM and analytics. Name formatting varies."

**4. Timeliness**
- Question: How fresh is the data? Any lag concerns?
- Example: "Real-time events available within 1 minute. CRM syncs nightly (max 24hr lag)."

**5. Validity**
- Question: Does data conform to expected formats/ranges?
- Example: "99% of records pass validation. 1% have invalid email formats."

**6. Uniqueness**
- Question: Any duplicate records or ID issues?
- Example: "Customer IDs unique in CRM. ~2% duplicate emails (family accounts)."

#### 3.3 Data Gaps (2-3 questions)
- What data is missing that would be valuable?
- Can missing data be collected?
- What's the plan for data gaps?

**Example Response:**
```
Critical Gaps:
1. Customer satisfaction scores (CSAT) - not currently collected
   → Plan: Implement post-interaction surveys (3-month timeline)

2. Product usage depth - only tracking logins, not feature usage
   → Plan: Enhanced analytics SDK deployment (1-month timeline)

3. Customer service call transcripts - not digitized
   → Plan: Out of scope for v1, consider for v2

Workarounds for v1:
- Use support ticket volume as proxy for satisfaction
- Use session duration as proxy for engagement depth
```

**Data Quality Scorecard Formula:**
```
Overall Score = Average(
  Completeness score,
  Accuracy score,
  Consistency score,
  Timeliness score,
  Validity score,
  Uniqueness score
)

Thresholds:
- 0.9-1.0: Excellent (green light)
- 0.7-0.89: Good (proceed with monitoring)
- 0.5-0.69: Fair (needs improvement)
- <0.5: Poor (data work required before ML)
```

**Stage 3 Deliverable**: `DataQualityScorecard`
- Overall quality score (0-1)
- Dimension scores for all 6 dimensions
- Data availability status
- Identified gaps with mitigation plans
- Data readiness assessment

#### 4.2 Decision-Making Process (3-4 questions)
- How will predictions be used in decision-making?
- Is this automated or human-in-the-loop?
- What happens when model predicts high risk?
- What's the appeal/override process?

**Example Response:**
```
Decision Process: Human-in-the-loop (semi-automated)

Workflow:
1. Model scores customers daily (automated)
2. High-risk customers (score >0.8) flagged in CRM
3. Retention specialist reviews top 50 cases
4. Specialist decides: call, email, discount offer, or ignore
5. Actions logged back to CRM

Human Override: Always allowed
- Specialist can ignore prediction if they have context
- Specialist can add customers not flagged by model
- All overrides tracked for model retraining

Automation Level: Predictions only, actions are manual
```

#### 4.3 Transparency Requirements (2-3 questions)
- Do users need to understand why a prediction was made?
- Should model explanations be provided?
- Are there regulatory transparency requirements?

**Example Response:**
```
Transparency Needs: Medium

Why Explanations Needed:
- Specialists want to understand prediction reasoning
- Helps tailor retention offer to specific risk factors
- Builds trust in model recommendations

Explanation Depth:
- Top 3 contributing features (e.g., "decreased usage, missed payments, low engagement")
- No need for technical details (SHAP values, feature importance scores)
- Simple language for business users

Regulatory: GDPR Article 22 (right to explanation)
- Customers can request explanation if asked
- Must be able to provide human-readable reasoning
```

#### 4.4 Unintended Consequences (2-3 questions)
- Could this AI system have negative impacts on users?
- Are there fairness concerns across user groups?
- What safeguards are needed?

**Example Response:**
```
Potential Negative Impacts:

1. False Positives
   - Impact: Customers receive unnecessary retention offers
   - Mitigation: High precision threshold (85%), human review

2. Self-Fulfilling Prophecy
   - Impact: Flagging customer as "at risk" could damage relationship
   - Mitigation: Retention offers framed positively, not desperation

3. Fairness Concerns
   - Impact: Model could discriminate by demographics
   - Mitigation: Fairness metrics monitored, demographic features excluded

Safeguards:
- Weekly model performance reviews
- Monthly fairness audits (precision/recall by segment)
- Human override always available
- Feedback loop to retrain model
```

**Stage 4 Deliverable**: `UserContext`
- Primary user roles and technical proficiency
- Usage frequency and decision-making process
- Transparency and explainability requirements
- Potential unintended consequences
- User feedback mechanisms
- Deployment safeguards

---

### Stage 5: Ethical Risk Assessment (15-20 Questions)

**Purpose**: Evaluate risks across 5 ethical principles and determine governance decision

**Framework**: EU AI Ethics Guidelines

The system evaluates your project against 5 ethical principles:

#### 5.1 Human Agency and Oversight

**Core Question**: Does this AI system preserve human autonomy and oversight?

**Sub-Questions:**
- Is the AI decision-making transparent to users?
- Can humans override AI decisions?
- Are users informed when interacting with AI?
- Is there meaningful human control?

**Risk Levels:**

| Risk Level | Description | Example |
|------------|-------------|---------|
| **Low (1/5)** | Full human control, AI is advisory only | Churn predictions reviewed by specialists, all actions manual |
| **Medium (3/5)** | Partial automation, human oversight on critical decisions | Auto-flag high risk, human approves retention offers |
| **High (4/5)** | Mostly automated, human oversight limited | Auto-send offers, human can review after the fact |
| **Critical (5/5)** | Fully automated, no human oversight | Auto-cancel accounts based on churn prediction |

**Mitigation Strategies:**
```
Risk: Medium (3/5) - Model flags customers, humans make final decisions

Mitigations:
1. Human-in-the-loop for all customer-facing actions
2. Weekly model performance reviews by data science team
3. Escalation process for edge cases
4. Quarterly ethics review by leadership

Residual Risk: Low (1/5) after mitigations
```

#### 5.2 Technical Robustness and Safety

**Core Question**: Is the AI system reliable, secure, and safe?

**Sub-Questions:**
- What happens if the model makes mistakes?
- How do you handle adversarial attacks?
- What's the model fallback strategy?
- Are there safety-critical failure modes?

**Example Assessment:**
```
Risks Identified:

1. Model Degradation Over Time
   - Initial Risk: High (4/5) - Model accuracy could decay as patterns change
   - Mitigation: Monthly retraining, automated drift detection
   - Residual Risk: Medium (2/5)

2. Data Poisoning
   - Initial Risk: Medium (3/5) - Malicious data could corrupt model
   - Mitigation: Input validation, anomaly detection, human review
   - Residual Risk: Low (1/5)

3. Adversarial Examples
   - Initial Risk: Low (2/5) - Unlikely customers game the system
   - Mitigation: Feature engineering to reduce gaming
   - Residual Risk: Low (1/5)

Fallback Strategy:
- If model unavailable: Use rule-based system (manual segmentation)
- If predictions unreliable: Revert to previous model version
- If data pipeline fails: Alert data team, delay predictions
```

#### 5.3 Privacy and Data Governance

**Core Question**: Does the system protect user privacy and handle data responsibly?

**Sub-Questions:**
- What personal data is collected?
- How is data stored and secured?
- Are users aware of data collection?
- Can users request data deletion?
- Does this comply with GDPR/CCPA?

**Example Assessment:**
```
Privacy Risks:

1. Sensitive Data Processing
   - Data Types: Demographics, purchase history, behavioral patterns
   - Risk Level: High (4/5) - PII and behavioral profiling
   - Mitigation:
     * Data minimization (only essential features)
     * Encryption at rest and in transit
     * Access controls (role-based)
     * Anonymization for analytics
   - Residual Risk: Medium (2/5)

2. Data Retention
   - Current: Indefinite storage
   - Risk: High (4/5) - GDPR requires limited retention
   - Mitigation: Implement 3-year retention policy, auto-deletion
   - Residual Risk: Low (1/5)

3. User Consent
   - Current: Implied consent via terms of service
   - Risk: Medium (3/5) - May not meet GDPR standards
   - Mitigation: Explicit opt-in for churn prediction, clear privacy notice
   - Residual Risk: Low (1/5)

Compliance:
- GDPR: Article 6 (lawful basis), Article 22 (automated decisions)
- CCPA: Right to know, right to delete implemented
- SOC 2: Data security controls in place
```

#### 5.4 Transparency

**Core Question**: Can stakeholders understand how the AI system works?

**Sub-Questions:**
- Can you explain model predictions in simple terms?
- Is the training data documented?
- Are model limitations communicated?
- Is there documentation for auditors?

**Example Assessment:**
```
Transparency Levels:

1. Model Explainability
   - Current: Black-box gradient boosting model
   - Risk: High (4/5) - Hard to explain to users/regulators
   - Mitigation:
     * SHAP values for feature importance
     * Simple business rules for top 3 drivers
     * Example-based explanations
     * Model card documentation
   - Residual Risk: Medium (2/5)

2. Data Lineage
   - Current: Documented in wiki, not version controlled
   - Risk: Medium (3/5) - Hard to audit
   - Mitigation: Implement data catalog (DataHub), lineage tracking
   - Residual Risk: Low (1/5)

3. Model Documentation
   - Current: Code comments, Jupyter notebooks
   - Risk: High (4/5) - Not audit-ready
   - Mitigation: Create model card (Google format), maintain model registry
   - Residual Risk: Low (1/5)

Audit Readiness: Medium
- Can explain predictions to users: Yes (SHAP + simple rules)
- Can explain to regulators: Partial (need better documentation)
- Can reproduce results: Yes (experiments tracked in MLflow)
```

#### 5.5 Fairness and Non-Discrimination

**Core Question**: Does the system treat all users fairly across demographic groups?

**Sub-Questions:**
- Could the model discriminate by age, gender, race, etc.?
- Are protected attributes used as features?
- Have you tested for disparate impact?
- What fairness metrics will you monitor?

**Example Assessment:**
```
Fairness Risks:

1. Demographic Bias
   - Protected Attributes: Age, gender, location (zip code proxy for race/income)
   - Risk: Critical (5/5) - High risk of discrimination
   - Mitigation:
     * Remove demographic features from model
     * Monitor performance across demographic segments
     * Fairness constraints (equalized odds)
     * Regular bias audits
   - Residual Risk: Medium (2/5)

2. Historical Bias
   - Training Data: Past retention campaigns targeted high-value customers
   - Risk: High (4/5) - Model may learn discriminatory patterns
   - Mitigation:
     * Balanced training data across segments
     * Debiasing techniques (reweighting)
     * Counterfactual fairness testing
   - Residual Risk: Medium (2/5)

3. Feedback Loops
   - Risk: Model predictions influence who gets offers, creating self-fulfilling prophecy
   - Risk Level: High (4/5)
   - Mitigation:
     * Randomized control group (10% not scored)
     * A/B testing to measure true impact
     * Periodic recalibration
   - Residual Risk: Low (1/5)

Fairness Metrics to Monitor:
- Demographic Parity: Churn prediction rate similar across groups
- Equalized Odds: TPR and FPR similar across groups
- Disparate Impact: Ratio >0.8 for all protected groups

Monitoring Plan:
- Weekly: Prediction distribution by segment
- Monthly: Full fairness audit across all metrics
- Quarterly: External fairness review
```

#### Governance Decision Algorithm

After assessing all 5 principles, the system makes an automated governance decision:

```python
Decision Logic:

IF any residual risk == CRITICAL (5/5):
    Decision = HALT
    Reasoning = "Critical unmitigated risks present"

ELIF residual risks HIGH (4/5) across 3+ principles:
    Decision = SUBMIT_TO_COMMITTEE
    Reasoning = "Multiple high-risk areas require committee review"

ELIF residual risks HIGH (4/5) in 1-2 principles:
    Decision = REVISE
    Reasoning = "High risks require mitigation before proceeding"

ELIF residual risks MEDIUM (2-3/5) with strong mitigations:
    Decision = PROCEED_WITH_MONITORING
    Reasoning = "Acceptable risks with active monitoring"

ELSE (all residual risks LOW 1-2/5):
    Decision = PROCEED
    Reasoning = "All risks mitigated to acceptable levels"
```

**Governance Decisions Explained:**

| Decision | Meaning | Next Steps |
|----------|---------|------------|
| **PROCEED** | All risks mitigated, project approved | Proceed to development |
| **PROCEED_WITH_MONITORING** | Acceptable risks, requires active monitoring | Proceed with quarterly reviews |
| **REVISE** | High risks need mitigation | Revise plans, address risks, resubmit |
| **SUBMIT_TO_COMMITTEE** | Complex risks need human judgment | Ethics committee review required |
| **HALT** | Critical risks, project not viable | Do not proceed, consider alternatives |

**Stage 5 Deliverable**: `EthicalRiskReport`
- Initial risks across 5 principles (severity 1-5)
- Mitigation strategies for each risk
- Residual risks after mitigations
- Governance decision with reasoning
- Monitoring and review plan

   - ❌ "Churn is bad."

3. **Use Numbers**
   - ✅ "50,000 customers, 2 years historical data, 500K transactions"
   - ❌ "Lots of data available"

4. **Acknowledge Uncertainties**
   - ✅ "We're not sure about data quality, estimated 80-90% complete"
   - ❌ Make up numbers or overpromise

5. **Respond to Follow-ups**
   - System asks clarifying questions when responses are vague
   - Don't rush - quality matters more than speed
   - Follow-ups help you think through details

### Quality Loop Best Practices

When the system asks follow-up questions:

**Vague Response:**
```
Q: What business problem are you trying to solve?
A: Improve sales.

System: Your response is too vague. Can you specify:
- What specific sales metric (revenue, conversion, deal size)?
- Current baseline value?
- Target improvement?
- Why is this important?
```

**Improved Response:**
```
A: We have a 15% conversion rate on sales calls, industry average is 25%.
This costs us ~$500K in lost revenue annually. We want to increase conversion
to 22% within 3 months by identifying which leads are most likely to convert.
```

**Why Quality Matters:**
- Better responses = more accurate charter
- Specificity prevents misunderstandings
- Numbers enable feasibility assessment
- Context helps identify risks

### Common Pitfalls to Avoid

1. **Solution First, Problem Second**
   - ❌ "We need a neural network for customer data"
   - ✅ "We need to predict which customers will churn"

2. **Overpromising Results**
   - ❌ "AI will solve all retention issues"
   - ✅ "AI can help identify at-risk customers for proactive outreach"

3. **Ignoring Non-AI Alternatives**
   - ❌ "Only AI can solve this"
   - ✅ "We tried rule-based segmentation, but 100+ variables make it infeasible"

4. **Vague Success Criteria**
   - ❌ "Better predictions"
   - ✅ "85% precision, 60% recall on churn predictions"

5. **Underestimating Data Work**
   - ❌ "Data is ready to go"
   - ✅ "Data quality is 85%, need to address 5% missing values and schema inconsistencies"

6. **Overlooking Ethical Risks**
   - ❌ "No fairness concerns"
   - ✅ "Risk of demographic bias, need to monitor precision/recall across age groups"

## Troubleshooting

### Session Issues

**Problem**: Session disconnected or timed out

**Solution**:
```bash
# Check session status
python -m src.cli.main status --session-id <session-id>

# Resume from last checkpoint
python -m src.cli.main resume --session-id <session-id>
```

**Problem**: Forgot session ID

**Solution**:
```bash
# List all your sessions
python -m src.cli.main list-sessions --user-id <your-user-id>
```

### Quality Validation Issues

**Problem**: System keeps asking follow-up questions

**Why**: Your responses are too vague or lack specifics

**Solution**:
- Add specific metrics and numbers
- Provide more context
- Give concrete examples
- If after 3 attempts system still rejects, it will escalate and accept your best answer

**Problem**: Response rejected as "too brief"

**Solution**:
- Minimum ~5 words for simple questions
- ~2-3 sentences for complex questions
- Include context, not just facts

**Problem**: Suspected prompt injection

**Why**: Your response contains phrases that look like attempts to manipulate the system

**Blocked Phrases** (avoid these):
- "Ignore previous instructions"
- "Forget everything"
- "System prompt"
- "You are now"

**Solution**: Rephrase naturally without these patterns

### Data Quality Issues

**Problem**: Low data quality score (<0.5)

**Impact**: Charter may recommend "REVISE" or "HALT"

**Solution**:
1. Review data quality dimension scores
2. Focus on lowest-scoring dimensions
3. Create mitigation plan
4. Consider data improvement project before ML development

**Problem**: Missing critical data

**Solution**:
1. Document gaps in Stage 3
2. Propose data collection plan
3. Identify proxies or workarounds
4. Charter will flag data risk

### Governance Decision Issues

**Problem**: Received "HALT" decision

**Meaning**: Critical unmitigated risks identified

**Next Steps**:
1. Review Stage 5 ethical assessment
2. Identify critical risks (severity 5/5)
3. Develop stronger mitigation strategies
4. Consider if project is ethically viable
5. If viable, restart interview with better mitigations

**Problem**: Received "SUBMIT_TO_COMMITTEE"

**Meaning**: Risks are complex and require human judgment

**Next Steps**:
1. Use charter to present to ethics committee
2. Prepare to discuss high-risk areas
3. Get committee approval before proceeding
4. Document committee decision

**Problem**: Received "REVISE"

**Meaning**: High risks need better mitigation

**Next Steps**:
1. Strengthen mitigation strategies
2. Restart Stage 5 with improved plans
3. Address specific high-risk areas
4. Aim for residual risks ≤ Medium (3/5)

### Technical Issues

**Problem**: Container won't start

```bash
# Check logs
docker-compose logs -f uaip-app

# Restart containers
docker-compose down
docker-compose up -d
```

**Problem**: Database connection error

```bash
# Verify Postgres is running
docker-compose ps

# Check database logs
docker-compose logs -f postgres

# Restart database
docker-compose restart postgres
```

**Problem**: LLM API timeout

**Cause**: External LLM service unresponsive (timeout after 30 seconds)

**Impact**: System will use fallback response or retry

**Solution**: Wait for retry or check LLM service status
