   - Session state tracking
   - Timestamp management

2. **Stage Progression**
   - Correct order enforcement
   - Stage advancement
   - Stage completion detection

3. **Quality Assessment**
   - Quality loop integration
   - Max iteration limits
   - Response validation

4. **Checkpoint System**
   - Checkpoint creation after each stage
   - Checkpoint restoration
   - Data integrity validation
   - Conversation history preservation

5. **Agent Coordination**
   - Stage agent registration
   - Reflection agent registration
   - Correct routing between agents
   - Context passing between stages

6. **Charter Generation**
   - Final charter generation
   - Governance decision making
   - Feasibility assessment

### Test Coverage
- **Overall**: 29.75% (low due to untested CLI/export modules)
- **Core Modules**: 66-99% coverage
- **Stage Agents**: 11-22% coverage (not tested in unit tests)

### Files Created
- `E2E_TEST_RESULTS.md` - Detailed test results
- `run_e2e_questionnaire.py` - Non-interactive E2E runner

---

## 🔍 Priority 2: Remove Stubs & Placeholders ⏳ PLANNED

### Identified Issues

**CLI Stubs** (src/cli/main.py):
- Line 810-812: `delete_command` - placeholder
- Line 1035-1040: `status_command` - placeholder
- Line 506-520: Resume shows "Coming in Phase 2" messages

**Stage Agents**:
- Mock implementations for testing
- Some question templates incomplete
- Dummy data in responses

**Database**:
- Some repository methods incomplete
- Need to verify all CRUD operations

### Action Plan
1. [ ] Complete CLI commands (delete, status)
2. [ ] Remove "Coming in Phase 2" messages
3. [ ] Verify stage agents use real LLM (not mocks)
4. [ ] Test all database operations
5. [ ] Remove mock data from responses

**Estimated Effort**: 8-12 hours  
**Status**: Ready to start

## 📋 Priority 3: End-to-End Test Suite ⏳ PLANNED

### Current Coverage
- ✅ 52 unit tests (100% passing)
- ✅ Stage progression tested
- ✅ Quality assessment tested
- ✅ Checkpoint system tested
- ✅ Charter generation tested

### What's Missing
- [ ] Real LLM interaction tests
- [ ] Complete questionnaire flow with real input
- [ ] Charter export verification (PDF, Markdown, JSON)
- [ ] Session persistence tests
- [ ] Error recovery scenarios
- [ ] Performance benchmarks

**Estimated Effort**: 8-12 hours  
**Status**: Ready to start

---

## 🎨 Priority 4: Graphical Frontend ⏳ PLANNED

### Recommended Stack
- **Frontend**: React 18 + TypeScript + Vite
- **Testing**: Vitest + React Testing Library
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS
- **Data**: React Query + Axios

### MVP Scope
1. Questionnaire UI (Stages 1-5)
2. Progress tracking
3. Session management
4. Charter preview
5. Export functionality

### Components to Build (TDD)
- QuestionnaireContainer
- StageComponent (generic)
- Stage1-5 Components
- SessionDashboard
- SessionDetail
- ExportModal

**Estimated Effort**: 40-60 hours  
**Status**: Ready to start

---

## 🚀 Next Immediate Actions

### Option A: Start Stabilization (Recommended)
```bash
# 1. Identify all stubs
grep -r "TODO\|FIXME\|PLACEHOLDER\|STUB" src/

# 2. Create tests for CLI commands
pytest tests/test_cli.py -v

# 3. Implement missing functionality
# ... (follow TDD approach)

# 4. Verify all tests pass
pytest tests/ -v
```

### Option B: Start Frontend
```bash
# 1. Create React project
npm create vite@latest uaip-frontend -- --template react-ts

# 2. Install dependencies
npm install

# 3. Create first test
npm run test

# 4. Build first component (TDD)
```
