## What Was Accomplished This Week

### 1. Security Hardening ✅

**Objective:** Fix 3 HIGH priority security vulnerabilities identified in code review.

#### Vulnerabilities Fixed

**H-1: Prompt Injection Vulnerability (CWE-77, OWASP A03:2021)**
- **Issue:** User input directly embedded in LLM prompts
- **Fix:** Implemented `_sanitize_for_prompt()` and `_detect_injection()` methods
- **Impact:** Prevents "ignore previous instructions" attacks
- **Location:** `src/conversation/engine.py:100-159`

**H-2: Denial of Service - Unlimited Input Size (CWE-400)**
- **Issue:** No size limits on user responses
- **Fix:** Added MAX_QUESTION_LENGTH=500, MAX_RESPONSE_LENGTH=10000, MAX_FOLLOW_UP_LENGTH=2000
- **Impact:** Prevents memory exhaustion and excessive API costs
- **Location:** `src/conversation/engine.py:19-23, 161-258`

**H-3: Session Context Leakage (CWE-200)**
- **Issue:** Session ID passed to external LLM APIs
- **Fix:** Removed session_id from external API context
- **Impact:** Protects user privacy, implements data minimization
- **Location:** `src/conversation/engine.py:335-343`

**BONUS: Timeout Handling**
- **Issue:** No timeout on async LLM calls
- **Fix:** Added 30-second timeouts with `asyncio.wait_for()`
- **Impact:** Prevents indefinite hangs, ensures system responsiveness
- **Location:** `src/conversation/engine.py:335-376, 420-443`

#### Security Test Results

```bash
# Conversation Engine Tests
tests/conversation/test_conversation_engine.py - 8/8 PASSED ✅

# Stage 1 Integration Tests
tests/integration/test_stage1_conversation_integration.py - 5/5 PASSED ✅

Total: 13/13 tests passing (100%) ✅
```

    │   │
    │   └─> _ask_single_question_with_conversation_engine()
    │       │
    │       ├─> Create ConversationContext(session_id, stage_number, question, max_attempts)
    │       │
    │       ├─> Create ConversationEngine(quality_agent, llm_router, context)
    │       │
    │       ├─> engine.start_turn(question)
    │       │
    │       ├─> Get user response via _get_user_response()
    │       │
    │       ├─> engine.process_response(user_response)
    │       │       │
    │       │       ├─> ResponseQualityAgent.evaluate_response()
    │       │       │
    │       │       ├─> IF quality < 7:
    │       │       │   ├─> Generate follow-up question
    │       │       │   ├─> Get improved response
    │       │       │   └─> Loop (max 3 attempts)
    │       │       │
    │       │       └─> IF quality >= 7:
    │       │           └─> Accept response
    │       │
    │       └─> Extract final response from conversation history
    │
    └─> ELSE (no quality_agent):
        │
        └─> _ask_single_question_fallback()
            └─> Use basic heuristic validation
```

## Lessons Learned

### What Went Exceptionally Well

1. **Security-First Approach** ✅
   - Addressing security vulnerabilities before expanding functionality prevented technical debt
   - Clear attack scenarios helped understand impact
   - Comprehensive testing ensured no regressions

2. **Pattern Reuse** ✅
   - Stage 1 pattern worked perfectly for Stages 2-3
   - Copy-paste-modify approach reduced errors
   - ~2 hours per stage agent integration

3. **Documentation Quality** ✅
   - Comprehensive documentation saved time explaining decisions
   - Examples with actual conversations made usage clear
   - Technical decisions documented for future reference

4. **Backwards Compatibility** ✅
   - Fallback mode preserved existing behavior
   - No breaking changes to existing tests
   - Smooth migration path for production systems

### Challenges Overcome

1. **Session Context Variability**
   - **Challenge:** Different agents use different context structures
   - **Solution:** Flexible attribute checking with fallback to default UUID
   - **Code:** `hasattr()` checks with graceful degradation

2. **Response Extraction from History**
   - **Challenge:** Multiple follow-up rounds made direct return complex
   - **Solution:** Use conversation history as single source of truth
   - **Code:** Filter messages by role, extract last user message

3. **Testing with Security Fixes**
   - **Challenge:** Needed to ensure security fixes didn't break functionality
   - **Solution:** Run full test suite after each security change
   - **Result:** 100% tests passing throughout

### Best Practices Established

1. **Router Pattern for Integration**
   ```python
   async def _ask_single_question(self, question: str) -> str:
       if self.quality_agent:
           return await self._ask_with_engine(question)
       else:
           return await self._ask_fallback(question)
   ```

2. **Helper Methods for Reusability**
   ```python
   async def _get_user_response(self, question: str) -> str:
       # Centralized LLM call logic
   ```

3. **Security Constants at Top**
   ```python
   MAX_QUESTION_LENGTH = 500
   MAX_RESPONSE_LENGTH = 10000
   TIMEOUT_SECONDS = 30
   ```

4. **Comprehensive Documentation**
   - Document attack scenarios prevented
   - Include code examples with before/after
   - Explain technical decisions with rationale
