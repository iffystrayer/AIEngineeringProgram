## Implementation Overview

### Integration Architecture

The same proven pattern from Stages 1-3 was applied to Stages 4 and 5:

```
Stage Agent (4 or 5)
     │
     ├─> _ask_single_question(question)
     │       │
     │       ├─> IF quality_agent PROVIDED:
     │       │   │
     │       │   ├─> _ask_single_question_with_conversation_engine()
     │       │   │       │
     │       │   │       ├─> Create ConversationContext(session_id, stage_number, question)
     │       │   │       │
     │       │   │       ├─> Create ConversationEngine(quality_agent, llm_router, context)
     │       │   │       │
     │       │   │       ├─> engine.start_turn(question)
     │       │   │       │
     │       │   │       ├─> _get_user_response(question)
     │       │   │       │
     │       │   │       ├─> engine.process_response(user_response)
     │       │   │       │       │
     │       │   │       │       ├─> quality_agent.evaluate_response()
     │       │   │       │       │
     │       │   │       │       ├─> IF quality < 7:
     │       │   │       │       │   ├─> Generate follow-up question
     │       │   │       │       │   ├─> _get_user_response(follow_up)
     │       │   │       │       │   └─> Loop (max 3 attempts)
     │       │   │       │       │
     │       │   │       │       └─> IF quality >= 7:
     │       │   │       │           └─> Return validated response
     │       │   │       │
     │       │   │       └─> Extract final response from history
     │       │   │
     │       │   └─> Return validated response
     │       │
     │       └─> ELSE (no quality_agent):
     │           │
     │           └─> _ask_single_question_fallback()
     │               └─> Use basic heuristic validation
     │
     └─> Return response
```

## Stage 4 Agent Integration

### Overview

**Stage 4: User Centricity Agent**
- Defines user personas and journey maps
- Establishes interpretability requirements
- Plans feedback mechanisms
- Ensures AI system aligns with user needs

### Changes Made

#### 1. Added Imports (lines 18-25)

```python
import asyncio
import logging
from dataclasses import dataclass
from datetime import datetime
from typing import Any
from uuid import UUID

from src.conversation import ConversationEngine, ConversationContext, MessageRole
```

#### 2. Updated Constructor (lines 94-134)

**Added `quality_agent` parameter:**
```python
def __init__(
    self,
    session_context: Any,
    llm_router: Any,
    quality_agent: Any = None,  # NEW: ResponseQualityAgent
    quality_threshold: float = 7.0,
    max_quality_attempts: int = 3,
):
    """
    Initialize Stage4Agent.

    Args:
        session_context: Session information with Stage 1-3 data
        llm_router: LLM routing service for API calls
        quality_agent: ResponseQualityAgent for response validation (optional)
        quality_threshold: Minimum quality score to accept responses (default: 7.0)
        max_quality_attempts: Maximum quality loop iterations per question (default: 3)
    """
    # Validate Stage 1-3 context exists
    if not hasattr(session_context, "stage1_data") or session_context.stage1_data is None:
        raise ValueError("Stage 1 data required for Stage 4 agent")

    self.session_context = session_context
    self.llm_router = llm_router
    self.quality_agent = quality_agent  # NEW: Store quality agent
    self.quality_threshold = quality_threshold
    self.max_quality_attempts = max_quality_attempts
```

#### 3. Rewrote `_ask_single_question()` Method (lines 300-317)

```python
async def _ask_single_question(self, question: str) -> str:
    """
    Ask a single question with quality validation loop.

    Uses ConversationEngine when quality_agent is available, otherwise falls back
    to basic heuristic validation.
    """
    # Route based on quality_agent availability
    if self.quality_agent:
        return await self._ask_single_question_with_conversation_engine(question)
    else:
        return await self._ask_single_question_fallback(question)
```

#### 4. Added ConversationEngine Integration Method (lines 319-382)

```python

    """
    Ask question using ConversationEngine for quality validation.
    """
    # Get session ID (handle different context types)

        session_id = self.session_context.id
    else:
        session_id = UUID("00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000")

    # Create conversation context for this question
    conversation_context = ConversationContext(

        stage_number=4,  # Stage 4 specific
        current_question=question,
        max_attempts=self.max_quality_attempts
    )

    # Create conversation engine
    engine = ConversationEngine(

    )

    # Start conversation turn
    await engine.start_turn(question)

    # Get user response
    user_response = await self._get_user_response(question)

    result = await engine.process_response(user_response)

    # Handle quality validation loop
    while not result["is_acceptable"] and not result.get("escalated"):
        follow_up_question = result.get("follow_up_question")

        if follow_up_question:
            # Ask follow-up question
            improved_response = await self._get_user_response(follow_up_question)

    user_messages = [msg for msg in history if msg.role == MessageRole.USER]

    if user_messages:
        return user_messages[-1].content

    return ""
```

#### 5. Added Fallback Method (lines 384-429)

```python
async def _ask_single_question_fallback(self, question: str) -> str:
    """
    Ask question with basic heuristic validation (fallback mode).
    """
    attempt = 0
    best_response = ""
    best_score = 0.0

        response = await self._get_user_response(question)

        quality_assessment = await self.validate_response_quality(

        if quality_assessment.is_acceptable:
            return response

        attempt += 1

    return best_response
```

#### 6. Added Helper Method (lines 431-456)

```python
async def _get_user_response(self, question: str) -> str:
    """
    Get user response to a question (via LLM or mock).

    Centralizes LLM call logic for reuse.
    """
    if hasattr(self.llm_router, "route") and callable(self.llm_router.route):
        llm_response = await self.llm_router.route(
            prompt=question,
            context=self.session_context,
        )
        # Handle different response formats
        if isinstance(llm_response, dict):
            return str(llm_response.get("response", llm_response.get("content", "")))
        elif hasattr(llm_response, "content"):
            return str(llm_response.content)
        else:
            return str(llm_response)
    else:
        return f"Mock response to: {question}"
```

### Stage 4 Question Groups

Stage 4 conducts 4 question groups with ConversationEngine integration:

1. **User Persona Definition**
   - Primary user types and roles
   - User expertise levels
   - User needs and pain points
   - Interaction patterns

2. **AI User Journey Mapping**
   - Journey stages (awareness, adoption, usage, mastery)
   - Critical touchpoints
   - Expected behaviors at each stage
   - Success criteria

3. **Interpretability Requirements**
   - Model decision explainability needs
   - Explanation formats (feature importance, SHAP, LIME)
   - Explanation depth and granularity
   - Regulatory requirements

4. **Feedback Mechanisms**
   - User feedback collection methods
   - Feedback loop integration
   - Model improvement based on feedback
   - User engagement tracking

**All questions now benefit from automatic quality validation loops.**

### Stage 5 Question Groups

Stage 5 conducts 5 question groups with ConversationEngine integration:

1. **Risk Self-Assessment**
   - Identified risk categories (bias, privacy, safety, transparency, accountability)
   - Risk descriptions and examples
   - Impact and likelihood assessment

2. **Principle-Specific Risk Mapping**
   - **Fairness & Non-Discrimination:** Bias risk assessment (0-10)
   - **Privacy & Data Protection:** Privacy risk assessment (0-10)
   - **Safety & Reliability:** Safety risk assessment (0-10)
   - **Transparency & Explainability:** Transparency risk assessment (0-10)
   - **Accountability & Governance:** Accountability risk assessment (0-10)

3. **Mitigation Strategy Planning**
   - Mitigation approaches for each risk
   - Implementation timeline
   - Responsible parties
   - Success metrics

4. **Residual Risk Calculation**
   - Post-mitigation risk levels
   - Acceptable risk thresholds
   - Risk acceptance justification

5. **Post-Deployment Monitoring**
   - Monitoring metrics and dashboards
   - Audit frequency
   - Incident response procedures
   - Continuous improvement processes

**All questions now benefit from automatic quality validation loops.**

## Code Changes Summary

### Files Modified

| File | Lines Changed | New Methods | Description |
|------|---------------|-------------|-------------|
| `src/agents/stage4_agent.py` | ~160 lines | 3 methods | ConversationEngine integration |
| `src/agents/stage5_agent.py` | ~160 lines | 3 methods | ConversationEngine integration |

### Method Breakdown

**Each agent now has:**
1. `_ask_single_question()` - Router method
2. `_ask_single_question_with_conversation_engine()` - ConversationEngine integration
3. `_ask_single_question_fallback()` - Backwards compatibility
4. `_get_user_response()` - Centralized LLM call logic

---

## Integration Pattern Comparison

### Before Integration

```python
# OLD: Direct LLM call with basic validation
async def _ask_single_question(self, question: str) -> str:
    attempt = 0
    while attempt < max_attempts:
        response = await llm_router.route(question)
        score = basic_heuristic_check(response)
        if score >= threshold:
            return response
        attempt += 1
    return best_response
```

**Limitations:**
- ❌ No intelligent follow-up questions
- ❌ No quality agent integration
- ❌ Basic heuristic validation only
- ❌ No conversation history tracking

### After Integration

```python
# NEW: ConversationEngine with quality validation loops
async def _ask_single_question(self, question: str) -> str:
    if self.quality_agent:
        # Use ConversationEngine
        engine = ConversationEngine(quality_agent, llm_router, context)
        await engine.start_turn(question)
        result = await engine.process_response(user_response)

        # Quality validation loop
        while not result["is_acceptable"] and not result["escalated"]:
            follow_up = result["follow_up_question"]
            improved = await get_response(follow_up)
            result = await engine.process_response(improved)

        return final_response
    else:
        # Fallback to basic validation
        return await self._ask_single_question_fallback(question)
```

**Benefits:**
- ✅ Intelligent follow-up questions generated by LLM
- ✅ ResponseQualityAgent integration for scoring
- ✅ Max 3 attempts enforcement (FR-3.5)
- ✅ Full conversation history tracking
- ✅ Backwards compatibility maintained

---

## Key Features

### 1. Automatic Quality Validation

Every response is validated by ResponseQualityAgent:
- Quality score (0-10) computed
- Threshold check (default: 7.0)
- Issues identified with specific feedback
- Suggested follow-ups generated

### 2. Intelligent Follow-up Questions

When quality is insufficient:
- LLM generates contextual follow-up
- Addresses specific quality issues
- Provides examples to guide improvement
- Max 3 attempts per FR-3.5

### 3. Conversation History Tracking

Full conversation maintained:
- All questions (ASSISTANT role)
- All responses (USER role)
- Timestamps for audit trail
- Metadata (attempt counts, quality scores)

### 4. Escalation Handling

After 3 failed attempts:
- Best response accepted with flag
- Escalation logged for review
- Prevents infinite loops
- Graceful degradation

### 5. Backwards Compatibility

Works with or without quality_agent:
- With quality_agent: Full ConversationEngine
- Without quality_agent: Fallback validation
- No breaking changes
- Smooth migration path

## Usage Examples

### Example 1: Creating Stage 4 Agent with ConversationEngine

```python
from src.agents.stage4_agent import Stage4Agent
from src.agents.reflection.response_quality_agent import ResponseQualityAgent
from src.llm.router import llm_router

# Create session context with Stages 1-3 data
session_context = Session(
    session_id=uuid4(),
    project_name="Customer Retention ML",
    stage1_data=problem_statement,  # From Stage 1
    stage2_data=metric_alignment,   # From Stage 2
    stage3_data=data_scorecard,     # From Stage 3
)

# Initialize quality agent
quality_agent = ResponseQualityAgent(llm_router=llm_router)

# Create Stage4Agent WITH ConversationEngine support
stage4_agent = Stage4Agent(
    session_context=session_context,
    llm_router=llm_router,
    quality_agent=quality_agent,  # Enables ConversationEngine
    quality_threshold=7.0,
    max_quality_attempts=3
)

# Conduct interview (uses ConversationEngine internally)
user_alignment = await stage4_agent.conduct_interview()
```

### Example 2: Creating Stage 5 Agent with ConversationEngine

```python
from src.agents.stage5_agent import Stage5Agent

# Create Stage5Agent WITH ConversationEngine support
stage5_agent = Stage5Agent(
    session_context=session_context,  # Must have stage1_data through stage4_data
    llm_router=llm_router,
    quality_agent=quality_agent,  # Enables ConversationEngine
    quality_threshold=7.0,
    max_quality_attempts=3
)

# Conduct interview (uses ConversationEngine internally)
ethical_risk_profile = await stage5_agent.conduct_interview()
```

### Example 3: Quality Validation Loop in Action (Stage 4)

```
Agent: "Define your primary user personas for this AI system"

User: "Data scientists"
      ↓
ConversationEngine → ResponseQualityAgent
      ↓
Quality Score: 5/10 (Too vague, needs specifics)
      ↓
Agent: "Can you provide specific details about each persona's expertise level, needs, and interaction patterns?"

User: "Senior data scientists (5+ years ML experience) who need interpretable models for regulatory compliance. They interact daily via Jupyter notebooks and dashboards, requiring SHAP value visualizations and feature importance rankings."
      ↓
ConversationEngine → ResponseQualityAgent

### Example 4: Quality Validation Loop in Action (Stage 5)

```
Agent: "Assess the FAIRNESS & NON-DISCRIMINATION risk (0-10) for this AI system"

User: "Low risk"
      ↓
ConversationEngine → ResponseQualityAgent
      ↓
Quality Score: 3/10 (Vague, no quantitative assessment)
      ↓
Agent: "Can you provide a specific risk score (0-10) with evidence of potential bias sources and impact analysis?"

User: "Risk score: 6/10. Potential bias from historical data reflecting past discrimination. Protected attributes (gender, race) not in training data but may be correlated with proxies. Mitigation: fairness metrics monitoring, bias testing across demographics, regular audits."
      ↓
ConversationEngine → ResponseQualityAgent
      ↓
Quality Score: 9/10 (Quantitative, evidence-based, mitigation-aware)
      ↓
Response ACCEPTED ✅
```

## Technical Decisions

### Decision 1: Consistent Method Names Across All Stages

**Decision:** Use identical method names (`_ask_single_question_with_conversation_engine`, `_ask_single_question_fallback`, `_get_user_response`) across all 5 stage agents.

**Rationale:**
- Easier to understand and maintain
- Copy-paste pattern reduces errors
- Clear mental model for developers
- Facilitates code review and onboarding

**Trade-off:** Slightly verbose names, but clarity and consistency win.

### Decision 2: Stage-Specific Validation Requirements

**Decision:** Stage 5 validates presence of all previous stages (1-4), while Stage 4 only requires Stage 1.

**Rationale:**
- Stage 4 can function independently with business context
- Stage 5 requires complete workflow context for comprehensive risk assessment
- Progressive validation prevents cascading failures
- Clear dependency hierarchy

**Code:**
```python
# Stage 4: Requires only Stage 1
if not hasattr(session_context, "stage1_data") or session_context.stage1_data is None:
    raise ValueError("Stage 1 data required for Stage 4 agent")

# Stage 5: Requires Stages 1-4
required_stages = ["stage1_data", "stage2_data", "stage3_data", "stage4_data"]
missing_stages = []
for stage_attr in required_stages:
    if not hasattr(session_context, stage_attr) or getattr(session_context, stage_attr) is None:
        missing_stages.append(stage_attr)
if missing_stages:
    raise ValueError(f"All stages 1-4 data required for Stage 5 agent. Missing: {missing_stages}")
```

### Decision 3: Complete Pattern Reuse from Stages 1-3

**Decision:** Apply exact same integration pattern without modifications to Stages 4-5.

**Rationale:**
- Pattern proven successful in Stages 1-3
- No need for optimization or customization
- Consistency more valuable than minor improvements
- Reduces testing and validation burden

**Alternative Considered:** Custom optimizations per stage - rejected due to added complexity.

### Decision 4: Quality Validation for Ethical Risk Assessment

**Decision:** Apply same quality threshold (7.0) and max attempts (3) to ethical risk assessment.

**Rationale:**
- Ethical assessment requires same rigor as other stages
- Consistent quality standards across workflow
- Risk assessment benefits from iterative refinement
- No evidence that ethics requires different thresholds

**Impact:** Stage 5 ethical risk assessments meet same quality bar as business and technical assessments.
