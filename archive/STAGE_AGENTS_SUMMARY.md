## Architecture & Design Patterns

### Consistent Structure Across All Stages
```python
class StageNAgent:
    def __init__(session_context, llm_router, quality_threshold=7.0, max_quality_attempts=3)
    
    async def conduct_interview() -> Deliverable
    async def ask_question_group(group_number: int) -> list[str]
    async def validate_response_quality(question, response) -> QualityAssessment
    
    # Stage-specific validation methods
    async def validate_X() -> ValidationResult
    async def generate_deliverable() -> StageDeliverable
```

### Quality Loop Pattern (Used by All Agents)
```python
attempt = 0
while attempt < max_quality_attempts:
    response = await llm_router.route(prompt)
    quality = await validate_response_quality(question, response)
    
    if quality.is_acceptable:  # score ≥ 7
        return response
    
    attempt += 1

return best_response  # After max attempts
```

### TDD Methodology Compliance ✅
**All agents follow strict TDD**:
1. ✅ Specification tests (always passing - living documentation)
2. ✅ Structure tests (skipped until implementation, then pass)
3. ✅ Execution tests (skipped until implementation, then pass)
4. ✅ Error handling tests
5. ✅ Integration tests

**Test-First Approach**:
- Tests written before implementation
- Conditional imports with `AGENT_AVAILABLE` flag
- `@pytest.mark.skipif(not AGENT_AVAILABLE)` for implementation tests
- Specification tests document requirements and always pass

## Governance Decision Flow (Stage 5)

```
Initial Risk Assessment
    ↓
Principle-by-Principle Mapping (5 principles)
    ↓
Severity (1-5) × Likelihood (1-5) = Risk Score (1-16)
    ↓
Mitigation Strategy Development (effectiveness 0-95%)
    ↓
Residual Risk = Initial × (1 - Σeffectiveness)
    ↓
Automated Governance Decision:
    → HALT: Critical/Safety issues
    → SUBMIT: 2+ High risks
    → REVISE: 1 High risk
    → PROCEED_WITH_MONITORING: Medium risks
    → PROCEED: All Low risks
```

## Integration with Orchestrator

### Data Flow
```
Orchestrator
    ↓
Stage 1: ProblemStatement → context.stage1_data
    ↓
Stage 2: MetricAlignmentMatrix → context.stage2_data
    ↓
Stage 3: DataQualityScorecard → context.stage3_data
    ↓
Stage 4: UserContext → context.stage4_data
    ↓
Stage 5: EthicalRiskReport → context.stage5_data
    ↓
StageGateValidator → Validates between stages
    ↓
CharterGenerator → Creates final AIProjectCharter
```

### Stage Dependencies
- **Stage 2** requires Stage 1 (ML archetype for metric recommendations)
- **Stage 3** requires Stage 1 (input features for data source mapping)
- **Stage 4** requires Stage 3 (data access levels for persona validation)
