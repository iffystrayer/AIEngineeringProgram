### STAGE 1: Business Translation

**Agent:** Stage1BusinessTranslationAgent
**Goal:** Transform business need into precise AI problem statement

#### Question Group 1: Core Business Objective

**Agent:** "What is the overarching business objective or operational pain point this AI project aims to address?"

**User (Initial - VAGUE):** "We want to improve customer retention"

**ConversationEngine Quality Check:**
```python
{
    "quality_score": 4,
    "is_acceptable": False,
    "issues": [
        "Too broad - 'improve customer retention' is not measurable",
        "No baseline or target mentioned",
        "Doesn't specify which aspect of retention"
    ]
}
```

**Agent Follow-up 1:** "What specific metric do you use to measure customer retention? (Examples: churn rate %, customer lifetime value, repeat purchase rate)"

**User (Clarification):** "We track monthly churn rate - currently it's around 5.2% per month"

**Agent Follow-up 2:** "What is your target churn rate, and by when do you want to achieve it?"

**User (Refined - HIGH QUALITY):** "We'd like to reduce monthly churn from 5.2% to 3.5% within 6 months"

**ConversationEngine Quality Check:**
```python
{
    "quality_score": 9,
    "is_acceptable": True,
    "issues": [],
    "suggested_followups": []
}
```

✅ **Response Accepted**

---

#### Question Group 2: AI Suitability Assessment

**Agent:** "Can this problem be solved effectively using simpler methods like deterministic rules, or is AI/ML genuinely required? Why do you need AI for this?"

**User:** "We've tried rule-based approaches - like flagging customers who haven't logged in for 30 days - but they're too simplistic. Churn patterns are complex and involve multiple signals: usage frequency, support tickets, billing issues, feature adoption. We need ML to find patterns we're missing."

**ConversationEngine Quality Check:**
```python
{
    "quality_score": 9,
    "is_acceptable": True,
    "issues": [],
    "suggested_followups": []
}
```

✅ **Strong justification - Response Accepted**

---

#### Question Group 3: Problem Definition (Inputs/Outputs)

**Agent:** "What specific data variables will the model use to make predictions? List all input features."

**User:**
```
- Customer demographics (age, company size, industry, account type)
- Usage metrics (login frequency, feature usage, session duration, active users)
- Transaction history (payment method, billing cycle, failed payments, MRR)
- Support interactions (ticket count, NPS scores, response times)
- Product engagement (features used, onboarding completion, certification status)
```

**Agent Follow-up:** "For PRODUCTION deployment, will ALL these features be available in real-time when you need to make a prediction?"

**User:** "Good point. Support response times might have a lag. We should exclude that. Everything else is real-time from our customer data platform via API."

**ConversationEngine Quality Check:**
```python
{
    "quality_score": 9,
    "is_acceptable": True,
    "issues": [],
    "suggested_followups": []
}
```

✅ **Excellent production-readiness validation**

---

**Agent:** "What is the TARGET OUTPUT? What specifically will the model predict?"

**User:** "Predict whether a customer will churn within the next 30 days, with a probability score."

**ConversationEngine Quality Check:**
```python
{
    "quality_score": 8,
    "is_acceptable": True,
    "issues": [],
    "suggested_followups": []
}
```

✅ **Clear target definition**

---

**Agent:** "Based on your inputs and output, what ML ARCHETYPE best describes this task?"

**User:** "Binary Classification - predicting churn (Yes/No) with probability"

**ConversationEngine Quality Check:**
```python
{
    "quality_score": 10,
    "is_acceptable": True,
    "issues": [],
    "suggested_followups": []
}
```

✅ **Perfect archetype mapping**

---

#### Question Group 4: Scope & Boundaries

**Agent:** "What will this project NOT do? Define the scope boundaries."

**User:** "Out of scope: (1) Predicting WHY customers churn (root cause analysis), (2) Automated intervention campaigns (marketing team handles), (3) Individual user-level predictions (account-level only), (4) Churn after contract renewal (only mid-contract churn)"

**ConversationEngine Quality Check:**
```python
{
    "quality_score": 9,
    "is_acceptable": True,
    "issues": [],
    "suggested_followups": []
}
```

✅ **Clear boundaries defined**

### 📦 Stage 1 Deliverable: ProblemStatement

```python
ProblemStatement(
    business_objective="Reduce monthly customer churn rate from 5.2% to 3.5% within 6 months",
    ai_necessity_justification="Rule-based methods insufficient for complex multi-signal churn patterns. ML required for pattern recognition across behavioral, transactional, and engagement features.",

### STAGE 2: Value Quantification

**Agent:** Stage2ValueQuantificationAgent
**Goal:** Establish measurable success criteria and causal linkages
**Context:** Receives Stage 1 ProblemStatement (ML archetype: Classification)

#### Question Group 1: Business KPIs (SMART Criteria)

**Agent:** "Define your primary business KPI. Make it SMART: Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, Time-bound."

**User (Initial):** "Reduce churn and increase revenue"

**ConversationEngine Quality Check:**
```python
{
    "quality_score": 3,
    "is_acceptable": False,
    "issues": [
        "Two separate KPIs (churn and revenue) - pick primary",
        "Not measurable - no baseline or target",
        "No timeframe specified"
    ]
}
```

**Agent Follow-up:** "Let's focus on ONE primary KPI. What's your baseline, target, and timeframe?"

**User (Refined):** "Primary KPI: Reduce monthly churn rate from 5.2% to 3.5% within 6 months (by Q2 2026). Secondary impact: Increase annual recurring revenue by $4.8M through churn reduction."

**ConversationEngine Quality Check:**
```python
{
    "quality_score": 9,
    "is_acceptable": True,
    "issues": [],
    "suggested_followups": []
}
```

✅ **SMART KPI defined**

---

#### Question Group 2: Technical Metrics Selection

**Agent:** "Given you're building a Binary Classification model, what MODEL METRICS will you use? (Examples: Precision, Recall, F1-Score, AUC-ROC)"

**User:** "We'll prioritize Precision and Recall. High precision to avoid false alarms (wrongly flagging loyal customers). High recall to catch actual churners. Target: Precision ≥ 75%, Recall ≥ 80%"

**ConversationEngine Quality Check:**
```python
{
    "quality_score": 9,
    "is_acceptable": True,
    "issues": [],
    "suggested_followups": []
}
```

✅ **Appropriate metrics for classification problem**

---

#### Question Group 3: Causal Connection Mapping

**Agent:** "Explain the CAUSAL PATHWAY: How does improving model precision/recall lead to reducing churn rate?"

**User (Initial - VAGUE):** "Better predictions mean better outcomes"

**ConversationEngine Quality Check:**
```python
{
    "quality_score": 2,
    "is_acceptable": False,
    "issues": [
        "Circular logic - 'better predictions → better outcomes' is not causal",
        "No mechanism explained",
        "Missing assumptions"
    ]
}
```

**Agent Follow-up:** "Walk me through the mechanism: Model predicts churn → Then what happens? → How does that reduce actual churn?"

**User (Refined):**
```
Causal Pathway:
1. Model identifies at-risk customers (Precision ≥ 75% minimizes false positives)
2. Customer Success team receives prioritized list (top 10% risk scores)
3. CS team proactively reaches out within 48 hours with retention offers
4. Interventions include: personalized training, feature enablement, pricing discussions
5. Historical data shows: 65% of proactively contacted at-risk customers don't churn
6. Result: 3.5% churn rate achieved through early intervention

Assumptions:
- CS team has capacity for 200 proactive contacts/month
- Retention offers have 65% success rate (validated from past manual campaigns)
- 48-hour intervention window before customer cancels

Failure Modes:
- CS team capacity exceeded (mitigate: prioritize top 5% risk scores)
- Intervention fatigue (mitigate: limit contacts to once per quarter)
- Model drift (mitigate: monthly retraining)
```

**ConversationEngine Quality Check:**
```python
{
    "quality_score": 10,
    "is_acceptable": True,
    "issues": [],
    "suggested_followups": []
}
```

✅ **Exceptional causal pathway with assumptions and failure modes**

---

#### Question Group 4: Prediction Actionability Window

**Agent:** "How much time do you have between the prediction and when you need to act?"

**User:** "Customers typically churn mid-cycle (15 days before renewal). Model predicts 30 days in advance. So we have 15-day window to intervene. Model inference is real-time (<500ms), so actionability window is sufficient."

**ConversationEngine Quality Check:**
```python
{
    "quality_score": 8,
    "is_acceptable": True,
    "issues": [],
    "suggested_followups": []
}
```

✅ **Actionability validated**

#### Question Group 4: Feedback Mechanisms

**Agent:** "How will you collect user feedback to improve the model over time?"

**User:**
```
Feedback Collection Methods:

1. Prediction Accuracy Feedback (Primary):
   - After 30 days: System asks "Did Customer XYZ churn? (Yes/No)"
   - CS manager confirms actual outcome
   - Track: True Positives, False Positives, False Negatives
   - Goal: Measure real-world precision/recall vs training metrics

2. Intervention Effectiveness Tracking:
   - When CS contacts customer, log: (a) Risk score at time of contact, (b) Intervention type, (c) Outcome
   - Build intervention playbook: "Offering discount works 80% for billing-issue churn"

3. User Satisfaction Survey (Quarterly):
   - Questions: "How confident are you in predictions? (1-10)", "What would improve the tool?"
   - NPS score for ML system

4. Model Performance Monitoring (Automated):
   - Weekly: Precision/Recall trends, calibration plots
   - Alert if precision drops below 70% (monthly retraining triggered)

Feedback Loop Integration:
- Labeled data → Retrain model monthly
- Feature requests → Product roadmap
- Intervention effectiveness → Optimize risk score thresholds
```

### STAGE 5: Ethical Governance

**Agent:** Stage5EthicsAgent
**Goal:** Identify, assess, and mitigate ethical risks with governance decisions
**Context:** Receives Stage 1-4 data (complete project context)

#### Question Group 1: Risk Self-Assessment

**Agent:** "Identify potential ethical risks across 5 principles: Fairness, Privacy, Transparency, Safety, Accountability. List risks you foresee."

**User:**
```
Identified Risks:

Fairness & Non-Discrimination:
- Risk: Model may learn historical bias (certain customer segments churned due to past poor service, not inherent traits)
- Concern: Over-flagging specific industries or company sizes
- Example: Small startups churned more historically (lack of resources) → Model may unfairly penalize new startups

Privacy & Data Protection:
- Risk: Customer usage data is sensitive (competitive intelligence)
- Concern: Dashboard access controls
- Example: Sales team accessing competitor usage patterns

Transparency & Explainability:
- Risk: CS team trusts "black box" without understanding
- Concern: Over-reliance on predictions without critical thinking
- Example: Ignoring qualitative signals because model says "low risk"

Safety & Reliability:
- Risk: False negatives (missing actual churners)
- Concern: Revenue loss from undetected churn
- Example: Model fails to predict sudden churn from competitor offer

Accountability & Governance:
- Risk: No clear ownership of model errors
- Concern: Who's responsible if model systematically misses churners?
- Example: Model predicts low risk, customer churns, CS blames ML team

#### Question Group 2: Principle-Specific Risk Mapping (Quantitative)

**Agent:** "Assess FAIRNESS & NON-DISCRIMINATION risk (0-10 scale, 0=no risk, 10=critical). Provide evidence."

**User (Initial - VAGUE):** "Medium risk"

**ConversationEngine Quality Check:**
```python
{
    "quality_score": 2,
    "is_acceptable": False,
    "issues": [
        "Vague 'medium' not quantitative",
        "No evidence or analysis",
        "No specific risk score"
    ]
}
```

**Agent Follow-up:** "Provide specific score (0-10) with evidence of potential bias sources and impact analysis."

**User (Refined):**
```
Fairness Risk Score: 6/10 (MEDIUM-HIGH)

Evidence:
- Historical data shows: Small companies (<50 employees) churn at 8.2% vs large (>500 employees) at 3.1%
- Protected attributes NOT in training data (no gender, race, age)
- Proxy risk: Company size, industry may correlate with founder demographics
- Example: Tech startups (often young founders) may be flagged due to size proxy

Potential Discriminatory Impact:
- Over-flagging startups → CS resources disproportionately allocated to enterprises
- Startups receive less proactive support → Self-fulfilling prophecy
- Estimated impact: 15% of startup customers may be unfairly deprioritized

Affected Stakeholders:
- Small businesses (2,000 customers, 20% of base)
- Underrepresented founder groups (indirect impact)

Severity: MEDIUM (unfair treatment, not legal harm)
Likelihood: HIGH (historical bias evident in data)
```

**ConversationEngine Quality Check:**
```python

}
```

✅ **Quantitative, evidence-based risk assessment**

---

**Agent:** "Assess PRIVACY & DATA PROTECTION risk (0-10)."

**User:**
```
Privacy Risk Score: 4/10 (LOW-MEDIUM)

Evidence:
- No PII in model (customer IDs anonymized)
- Aggregated usage data only (no individual user tracking)
- GDPR compliant (EU customers data processed in EU)
- No data sharing with third parties

Concerns:
- Dashboard shows customer names (necessary for CS workflow)
- Risk of unauthorized access if credentials leaked
- Sensitive: Churn risk = competitive intelligence (knowing struggling customers)

Mitigation Already in Place:
- Role-based access control (RBAC)
- Audit logging (who viewed which customer)
- Data retention: 2 years (GDPR compliant)

Residual Risks:
- Insider threat (CS team could leak competitor churn data)
- Estimated likelihood: LOW (vetted employees, NDAs signed)

Severity: MEDIUM (competitive harm, not personal privacy breach)
Likelihood: LOW (strong access controls)
```

**ConversationEngine Quality Check:**
```python
{
    "quality_score": 9,

✅ **Thorough privacy assessment**

---

**Agent:** "Assess SAFETY & RELIABILITY risk (0-10)."

**User:**
```
Safety Risk Score: 5/10 (MEDIUM)

Evidence:
- False Negative Risk (High Impact):
  * Model misses actual churner → No intervention → Customer lost
  * Historical: 20% of churners had no warning signals
  * Impact: $15K customer lifetime value lost per false negative
  * Estimated: ~100 false negatives/year = $1.5M revenue at risk

- False Positive Risk (Lower Impact):
  * Model flags happy customer → Unnecessary outreach → Minor annoyance
  * Impact: Wasted CS time (~30 min per false alarm)
  * Estimated: ~300 false positives/year = 150 hours CS time

- Model Drift Risk:
  * Customer behavior changes (new competitor, economic recession)
  * Model trained on pre-recession data may underperform
  * Mitigation: Monthly retraining, performance monitoring

Failure Modes:
1. Data pipeline outage → No predictions → Reactive mode (fallback to manual)
2. Model confidence collapse → All scores near 50% → No prioritization
3. Concept drift → Precision drops from 75% to 50% → False alarm fatigue

Safety Measures:
- Human-in-the-loop (CS final decision on intervention)
- Fallback: Manual review of top 20 accounts if model fails
- Graceful degradation (use last week's scores if real-time unavailable)

Severity: MEDIUM-HIGH (revenue impact)
Likelihood: MEDIUM (model drift expected, mitigations in place)
```

**ConversationEngine Quality Check:**
```python
{
    "quality_score": 10,
    "is_acceptable": True
}
```

✅ **Comprehensive safety analysis**

---

**Agent:** "Assess TRANSPARENCY & EXPLAINABILITY risk (0-10)."

**User:**
```
Transparency Risk Score: 3/10 (LOW)

Evidence:
- High interpretability designed (Stage 4): SHAP values → business language
- Dashboard shows top 3 contributing factors for each prediction
- CS team trained on model limitations
- Documentation available: How model works, what it can/cannot predict

Concerns:
- Over-reliance risk: CS team blindly trusts predictions without critical thinking
- Example: Model says "low risk" but customer explicitly complained → CS ignores complaint

Mitigation:
- Training emphasizes: Model is tool, not replacement for judgment
- Encourage: "Trust but verify" - review risk factors, not just score
- Feedback loop: Report when model was wrong to build calibration

Severity: LOW (decision-support tool, not autonomous system)
Likelihood: LOW (training + explainability features)
```

**ConversationEngine Quality Check:**
```python
{
    "quality_score": 9,
    "is_acceptable": True
}
```

✅ **Transparency well-addressed**

---

**Agent:** "Assess ACCOUNTABILITY & GOVERNANCE risk (0-10)."

**User:**
```
Accountability Risk Score: 4/10 (LOW-MEDIUM)

Evidence:
- Clear ownership: ML team owns model, CS team owns interventions
- Incident response plan: If model systematically fails, escalate to VP of Engineering
- Metrics tracked: Precision, Recall, Financial impact (churn reduction)

Concerns:
- Blame attribution: If churn increases, is it model failure or CS team failure?
- Example: Model correctly predicts churn, but CS team too busy to intervene → Whose fault?

Governance Structure:
- Monthly Review: ML team + CS leadership
- Quarterly: Executive review (CEO, CFO, CTO)
- Annual: External audit (ethics review by advisory board)

Accountability Measures:
- Model SLA: Precision ≥ 70%, Recall ≥ 75% (below → investigate)
- CS SLA: 80% high-risk customers contacted within 48 hours
- Clear escalation: Model underperforms → ML team fixes, CS underperforms → VP CS addresses

Severity: LOW-MEDIUM (internal tool, clear ownership)
Likelihood: LOW (governance structure in place)

#### Question Group 3: Mitigation Strategy Planning

**Agent:** "For FAIRNESS risk (6/10), propose mitigation strategies with effectiveness estimates."

**User:**
```
Mitigation Strategies for Fairness Risk:

1. Fairness Constraints in Training (Effectiveness: 70%):
   - Technique: Equalized odds constraint (equal false positive rates across company sizes)
   - Implementation: scikit-learn FairLearn library
   - Timeline: 2 weeks (retraining with fairness constraints)
   - Cost: $5K (ML engineer time)
   - Validation: Monitor precision/recall by company size segment

2. Stratified Sampling (Effectiveness: 60%):
   - Technique: Oversample small companies in training data to balance historical bias
   - Implementation: SMOTE for minority class (startups)
   - Timeline: 1 week
   - Cost: $2K
   - Trade-off: May reduce overall precision slightly

3. Bias Auditing (Effectiveness: 50% - detection, not mitigation):
   - Technique: Monthly fairness reports (precision/recall by segment)
   - Implementation: Automated dashboard (Evidently AI)
   - Timeline: 1 week setup
   - Cost: $3K + $500/month monitoring
   - Alert if disparity > 10% between segments

4. CS Process Changes (Effectiveness: 40%):
   - Technique: Reserve 20% of CS capacity for "manually reviewed" startups (not just model-driven)
   - Implementation: Process change (no tech)
   - Timeline: Immediate
   - Cost: $0 (reallocate existing capacity)
   - Limitation: Doesn't fix model bias, compensates for it

Combined Effectiveness: 90% (1 - 0.3 × 0.4 × 0.5 × 0.6 = 0.964, capped at 95%)

#### Question Group 4: Residual Risk Calculation

**Agent:** "After mitigations, what's the RESIDUAL risk for each principle?"

**User:**
```
Residual Risk Calculation:

Fairness:
- Initial: 6/10
- Mitigation Effectiveness: 90%
- Residual: 6 × (1 - 0.90) = 0.6 → Rounds to 1/10 (LOW)

Privacy:
- Initial: 4/10
- Mitigations: Enhanced access controls (80% effective)
- Residual: 4 × 0.2 = 0.8 → Rounds to 1/10 (LOW)

Safety:
- Initial: 5/10
- Mitigations: Monthly retraining, human-in-the-loop (70% effective)
- Residual: 5 × 0.3 = 1.5 → Rounds to 2/10 (LOW)

Transparency:
- Initial: 3/10
- Mitigations: Training, explainability features (60% effective)
- Residual: 3 × 0.4 = 1.2 → Rounds to 1/10 (LOW)

Accountability:
- Initial: 4/10
- Mitigations: Governance structure (70% effective)
- Residual: 4 × 0.3 = 1.2 → Rounds to 1/10 (LOW)

Maximum Residual Risk: 2/10 (LOW) - Safety principle

#### Question Group 5: Post-Deployment Monitoring

**Agent:** "How will you monitor ethical risks after deployment?"

**User:**
```
Continuous Monitoring Plan:

1. Fairness Monitoring (Monthly):
   - Metrics: Precision/Recall by customer segment (size, industry)
   - Alert: If disparity > 10% between segments
   - Action: Retrain with additional fairness constraints

2. Model Drift Detection (Weekly):
   - Metrics: Precision, Recall, Calibration
   - Alert: If precision drops below 70%
   - Action: Investigate (data quality issue? concept drift? new competitor?)

3. User Feedback Analysis (Quarterly):
   - Survey: CS team confidence in predictions
   - Qualitative: "Did model miss any obvious churners?"
   - Action: Feature engineering improvements

4. Incident Tracking (Continuous):
   - Log: False negatives causing significant revenue loss (>$50K)
   - Review: Root cause analysis for each incident
   - Action: Model updates or process changes

5. Governance Review (Quarterly):
   - Meeting: ML team + CS leadership + Ethics officer
   - Review: Aggregate fairness metrics, incidents, user satisfaction
   - Decision: Approve continued deployment or require changes

Audit Trail:
- All predictions logged (customer ID, risk score, factors, timestamp)
- All CS interventions logged (action taken, outcome)
- Retention: 3 years for compliance audits

    Maximum residual risk: LOW (2/10 - Safety principle)

    Decision: PROCEED WITH MONITORING

    Rationale:
    - All residual risks are LOW after mitigation (max 2/10)
    - No HIGH or CRITICAL residual risks
    - Comprehensive monitoring plan in place
    - Strong governance structure (monthly ML reviews, quarterly leadership reviews)
    - Mitigations are practical and cost-effective ($17K one-time + $700/month)
    - Expected benefit ($4.8M ARR saved) far exceeds mitigation costs

    Conditions for Proceeding:
    1. Implement fairness constraints before production launch (2 weeks)
    2. Monthly fairness audits (automated) - alert if disparity > 10%
    3. Quarterly governance reviews with ethics officer
    4. Incident response plan for systematic failures (>10 false negatives/month)

    Monitoring Requirements:
    - Weekly: Model performance metrics (precision/recall)
    - Monthly: Fairness metrics by segment
    - Quarterly: User satisfaction + governance review
    - Annual: External ethics audit

    Escalation Criteria:
    - If precision drops below 70% for 2 consecutive weeks → Investigate + potential rollback
    - If fairness disparity exceeds 15% → Retrain with stronger constraints
    - If 3+ major incidents (>$50K revenue loss from false negatives) in quarter → Halt and review

## 2. Problem Definition

### AI Problem Statement
Predict whether a B2B SaaS customer will churn within the next 30 days using historical behavioral, transactional, and engagement data.

**Why AI is Required:**
Rule-based methods (e.g., "30-day login threshold") insufficient for complex multi-signal churn patterns. ML required to find non-obvious patterns across 6 feature groups.

### ML Archetype: Binary Classification
**Justification:** Problem structure matches classification (predict categorical outcome: churn/no-churn) with probability score output.

### Input Features (Production-Validated)
| Feature Group | Data Source | Availability | Latency |
|--------------|-------------|--------------|---------|
| Demographics | Customer DB (PostgreSQL) | Real-time | <50ms |
| Usage Metrics | Analytics (Snowflake) | Streaming | <100ms |
| Transaction History | Billing System | Real-time | <80ms |
| Support Tickets | Zendesk API | Real-time | <60ms |
| Product Engagement | Amplitude | Real-time | <90ms |
| NPS Scores | Survey Platform | Real-time | <120ms |

**All features validated for production deployment (<200ms total latency).**

### Target Output
- **Type:** Binary Classification (churn probability)
- **Format:** Float [0.0-1.0]
- **Interpretation:** 70%+ = High Risk, 30-70% = Medium, <30% = Low

### Scope Boundaries
**In Scope:**
- 30-day churn prediction
- Account-level predictions
- Mid-contract churn

**Out of Scope:**
- Root cause analysis (why customers churn)
- Automated intervention campaigns
- Individual user-level predictions
- Post-renewal churn

## 4. User Context and Interaction

### Primary User Persona: Senior Customer Success Manager
**Name:** Sarah (Representative)
**Role:** Manages 50 high-value accounts ($50K+ ARR)
**Technical Proficiency:** Intermediate (dashboards, not SQL)

**Daily Workflow:**
1. Morning dashboard check (5-10 min)
2. Prioritize top 5 red-flag accounts
3. Schedule proactive calls (same day for critical, 48h for high)
4. Document interventions in CRM

**Needs:**
- Proactive early warning (not reactive)
- Prioritized daily action list
- Avoid false alarms (wasted time on happy customers)

**AI Interaction:**
- Daily dashboard (risk scores + top contributing factors)
- Click customer → See risk breakdown (usage drop, support tickets, billing)
- Mark action taken → Feedback loop closes

### Secondary Persona: VP of Customer Success
**Role:** Oversees 8-person CS team, strategic decisions
**Needs:** Weekly aggregated metrics, cohort trends, intervention effectiveness

### AI User Journey
**Awareness (Week 1):** Kickoff demo → Team understands benefits
**Adoption (Week 2-3):** Daily email alerts → 50% daily usage
**Usage (Month 2-3):** Dashboard integration → 80% contact rate within 48h
**Mastery (Month 4+):** Feedback loop → 3.5% churn achieved

### Interpretability: HIGH
**Required Explainability:**
- Risk score decomposition (top 3 factors): "70% risk = 40% usage drop + 20% support tickets + 10% billing"
- What-if analysis: "If customer logs in 5× this week, risk drops to 45%"
- Historical trends: "Risk increased from 30% (last week) to 70% (this week)"

**Format:** Visual dashboards + 1-2 sentence summaries (no technical jargon)
**Method:** SHAP values → business language translation

## 5. Metric Alignment Matrix

### Business-Technical Mapping

| Business KPI | Technical Metric | Target | Causal Pathway |
|-------------|------------------|--------|----------------|
| Reduce churn 5.2% → 3.5% | Precision ≥ 75% | Minimize false alarms | High precision → Accurate list → CS intervenes → 65% retention → Churn reduced |
| | Recall ≥ 80% | Catch actual churners | High recall → Few missed churners → Maximum intervention coverage |

### Causal Mechanism
1. Model identifies at-risk customers (Precision 75% → few false positives)
2. CS team receives prioritized list (top 10% risk scores)
3. CS proactively reaches out within 48 hours
4. Interventions: training, feature enablement, pricing discussions
5. **Historical validation:** 65% of contacted at-risk customers retained
6. **Result:** Churn rate 5.2% → 3.5% achieved

**Assumptions:**
- CS capacity: 200 contacts/month
- Retention offer success rate: 65% (validated from past campaigns)
- Intervention window: 48 hours

**Failure Modes & Mitigations:**
- CS capacity exceeded → Prioritize top 5% risk scores
- Intervention fatigue → Limit contacts to once per quarter
- Model drift → Monthly retraining

### Actionability Window
**Time Available:** 15 days (30-day prediction - 15-day typical churn timing)
**Inference Latency:** <500ms
**Result:** ✅ Sufficient actionability window

### Impact Validation Plan
**Method:** A/B test (50% ML-driven, 50% control) for 3 months
**Metrics:** Compare churn rates between groups

- Safety & Reliability
- Transparency & Explainability
- Accountability & Governance

### Principle-Specific Risk Analysis

#### 1. Fairness & Non-Discrimination
**Initial Risk:** 6/10 (MEDIUM-HIGH)
**Issue:** Historical bias - small companies over-flagged (8.2% churn vs 3.1% for large)

**Mitigation Strategies:**
- Fairness constraints in training (FairLearn, 70% effective, $5K, 2 weeks)
- Stratified sampling (SMOTE, 60% effective, $2K, 1 week)
- Monthly bias auditing (Evidently AI, 50% detection, $3K + $500/month)
- Reserve 20% CS capacity for manual startup review (40% effective, $0)

**Residual Risk:** 1/10 (LOW)

---

#### 2. Privacy & Data Protection
**Initial Risk:** 4/10 (LOW-MEDIUM)
**Issue:** Competitive intelligence exposure (churn data in dashboard)

**Mitigation Strategies:**
- Enhanced RBAC with audit logging (AWS IAM, 80% effective, $3K, 1 week)

**Residual Risk:** 1/10 (LOW)

---

#### 3. Safety & Reliability
**Initial Risk:** 5/10 (MEDIUM)
**Issue:** False negatives → $1.5M/year revenue at risk (~100 missed churners)

**Mitigation Strategies:**
- Monthly model retraining (drift detection, 50% effective, $5K + $200/month)
- Human-in-the-loop (CS final decision, 60% effective, $0)

**Residual Risk:** 2/10 (LOW)

---

#### 4. Transparency & Explainability
**Initial Risk:** 3/10 (LOW)
**Issue:** Over-reliance on "black box" without critical thinking

**Mitigation Strategies:**
- SHAP explainability + CS training (60% effective, $4K, 1 week)

**Residual Risk:** 1/10 (LOW)

---

#### 5. Accountability & Governance
**Initial Risk:** 4/10 (LOW-MEDIUM)
**Issue:** Unclear blame attribution if model systematically fails

**Mitigation Strategies:**
- Quarterly governance review meetings (70% effective, $0)

**Residual Risk:** 1/10 (LOW)

---

### Residual Risk Summary

**Maximum Residual Risk:** 2/10 (LOW) - Safety principle

**All residual risks LOW after mitigation.**

---

### Governance Checkpoint Decision

╔══════════════════════════════════════════════════════╗
║  DECISION: ✅ PROCEED WITH MONITORING               ║
╚══════════════════════════════════════════════════════╝

**Rationale:**
- All residual risks are LOW (max 2/10)
- No HIGH or CRITICAL residual risks remaining
- Comprehensive monitoring plan in place
- Strong governance structure (monthly ML + quarterly leadership reviews)
- Mitigations practical and cost-effective ($17K one-time + $700/month)
- Expected benefit ($4.8M ARR saved) >>> mitigation costs (282× ROI)

- Fairness disparity > 15% → Retrain with stronger constraints
- 3+ major incidents (>$50K revenue loss) in quarter → Halt and review

---

## 7. Operational Strategy

### Continuous Monitoring Plan
**Model Drift Monitoring (Weekly):**
- Precision, Recall, Calibration
- Alert threshold: <70% precision

**Fairness Monitoring (Monthly):**
- Precision/Recall by customer segment
- Alert threshold: >10% disparity between segments

**User Feedback (Quarterly):**
- CS team confidence survey
- Model accuracy confirmation (30-day follow-up)

### Maintenance & Retraining
**Retraining Triggers:**
- Performance degrades below 70% precision
- Data distribution shifts detected
- Monthly scheduled retraining (proactive)

**Retraining Process:**
- Automated pipeline (AWS SageMaker)
- Validation on hold-out set
- A/B test new model vs current (1 week)
- Gradual rollout (10% → 50% → 100%)

### Incident Response
**If Model Fails:**
1. Immediate: Revert to manual CS review (top 20 accounts)
2. Within 48h: Root cause analysis (data issue? drift? bug?)
3. Within 1 week: Corrective action (retrain? feature fix? rollback?)

**Escalation Path:**
- Model underperformance → ML Team Lead
- Systematic bias detected → Ethics Officer
- Revenue impact > $50K → VP Engineering + CFO
