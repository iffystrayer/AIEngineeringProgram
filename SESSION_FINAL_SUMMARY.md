## 📝 Key Implementation Highlights

### Form Validation with Zod
```typescript
// Dynamic schema generation from field configs
const schemaShape: Record<string, z.ZodTypeAny> = {}
fields.forEach((field) => {
  schemaShape[field.name] = createValidationSchema(field)
})
const validationSchema = z.object(schemaShape)
```

### Route Structure
```typescript
<Route path="/" element={<LandingPage />} />
<Route element={<Layout />}>
  <Route path="/dashboard" />
  <Route path="/sessions" />
  <Route path="/sessions/:id" />
  <Route path="/sessions/:id/stage/:stageId" />
  <Route path="/sessions/:id/consistency" />
  <Route path="/charter/:id" />
</Route>
```

### Consistency Checking Algorithm
```typescript
// 6-point validation system
- Problem Statement Clarity (min 50 chars)
- Metric Definition (min 30 chars)
- Data Quality Assessment (min 40 chars)
- Impact Assessment (min 50 chars)
- Governance Structure (min 50 chars)
- Questionnaire Completeness (all fields required)

// Overall scoring
Pass Rate = (Passing Checks / Total Checks) * 100%
```

### Multi-Format Charter Export
```typescript
// Supported formats
- PDF (text export, ready for PDF conversion)
- Markdown (formatted with proper structure)
- JSON (programmatic export for integration)
```

## 📞 Support & Troubleshooting

### Quick Start Commands
```bash
# Start backend
.venv/bin/python -m uvicorn src.api.main:app --reload --port 38937

# Start frontend
cd frontend && npm run dev

# Run tests
npm test -- --run

# Run backend tests
.venv/bin/python -m pytest tests/test_rest_api.py -v
```

### Common Issues
- Port already in use? Use `lsof -i :38937` to check
- Tests failing? Run `npm install` to ensure dependencies
- API not connecting? Verify backend is running on port 38937
- Build failing? Check Node version (need 16+)
