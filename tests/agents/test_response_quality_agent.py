Test-Driven Development Test Suite for ResponseQualityAgent

This test suite defines the complete specification for the ResponseQualityAgent
before implementation. Following strict TDD methodology:
1. TestSpecification - Always passes (requirements documentation)
2. TestStructure - Skipped until implementation exists
3. TestExecution - Skipped until implementation exists
4. TestCapabilities - Skipped until implementation exists
5. TestIntegration - Skipped until implementation exists
6. TestErrorHandling - Skipped until implementation exists

The agent will be implemented ONLY after all tests are written and verified.

        ResponseQualityAgent Requirements (SWE Spec Section 4.3.1):

        PURPOSE:
        - Evaluate individual response quality on 0-10 scale
        - Identify vagueness, gaps, and logical issues
        - Generate targeted follow-up questions to improve responses
        - Enforce quality threshold of 7/10
        - Limit reflection loops to maximum 3 attempts

        INPUTS:
        - question: str - The question asked to the user
        - user_response: str - The user's answer
        - stage_context: StageContext - Current stage information

        OUTPUTS:
        - QualityAssessment with:
          - quality_score: int (0-10)
          - is_acceptable: bool (score >= 7)
          - issues: List[str] (specific problems identified)
          - suggested_followups: List[str] (2-3 targeted questions)
          - examples_to_provide: List[str] (better response examples)

        EVALUATION CRITERIA:
        1. Specificity - Is it concrete or vague?
        2. Measurability - Can we quantify this?
        3. Completeness - Does it fully answer the question?
        4. Coherence - Is it logically consistent?
        5. Relevance - Does it stay on topic?

        SCORING SCALE:
        - 9-10: Excellent (specific, measurable, complete)
        - 7-8: Good (mostly clear, minor gaps acceptable)
        - 5-6: Needs improvement (vague or incomplete)
        - 0-4: Insufficient (requires complete rework)

        QUALITY THRESHOLD:
        - Score >= 7: Accept response (is_acceptable = True)
        - Score < 7: Reject response (is_acceptable = False)

        COMMUNICATION STYLE:
        - Firm but constructive
        - Specific about issues
        - Provide 2-3 targeted follow-ups
        - Include examples of better responses
        - Explain WHY specificity matters for AI project success

        INTEGRATION:
        - Called by Stage Interview Agents after each user response
        - Works with Orchestrator to enforce max 3 reflection loops
        - Prevents stage progression when responses are insufficient

        5. If score < 7: Generate follow-ups and loop (max 3x)
        6. After 3 loops: Escalate or accept with warning

        DEPENDENCIES:
        - Requires LLM router for LLM-based evaluation
        - Receives questions and responses from Stage Interview Agents
        - Returns QualityAssessment to Orchestrator

    4. ⏭️  TestCapabilities (8 tests) - Skipped until implementation
    5. ⏭️  TestIntegration (4 tests) - Skipped until implementation
    6. ⏭️  TestErrorHandling (7 tests) - Skipped until implementation

    Total Tests: 32 tests
    - Specification: 2 (always pass)
    - Implementation: 30 (skipped until agent built)

    Next Step: Implement ResponseQualityAgent to make tests pass

    Implementation Checklist:
    □ Create src/agents/reflection/response_quality_agent.py
    □ Implement ResponseQualityAgent class
    □ Implement QualityAssessment dataclass
    □ Implement evaluate_response() method
    □ Use LLM for quality evaluation
    □ Implement 5-dimension evaluation (specificity, measurability, etc.)
    □ Enforce threshold of 7/10
    □ Generate targeted follow-ups (2-3)
    □ Provide examples of better responses
    □ Handle error cases gracefully
    □ Verify all 32 tests pass
