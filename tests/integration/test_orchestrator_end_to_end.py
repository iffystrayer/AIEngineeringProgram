        The Orchestrator coordinates a complete interview workflow:

        1. Session Initialization
           - Create new session with user_id and project_name
           - Initialize stage agents with ConversationEngine support
           - Setup quality tracking and checkpoint management

        2. Stage 1: Problem Definition (with ConversationEngine)
           - Ask 4 question groups about business problem
           - Use ConversationEngine for quality-validated responses
           - Detect prompt injection, validate input sizes
           - Generate ProblemStatement deliverable

        3. Stage Gate 1 Validation
           - Invoke StageGateValidatorAgent
           - Verify ProblemStatement completeness
           - Create checkpoint if passed

        4. Stage 2: Success Criteria (with ConversationEngine)
           - Define business KPIs and ML metrics
           - Quality loop for metric specifications
           - Generate MetricAlignmentMatrix

        5. Stage Gate 2 Validation
           - Validate metric definitions
           - Check alignment between business and ML metrics

        6. Stage 3: Data Assessment (with ConversationEngine)
           - Evaluate data quality and completeness
           - Generate DataQualityScorecard

        7. Stage Gate 3 Validation
           - Validate data quality scores
           - Check for data availability concerns

        8. Stage 4: User Impact (with ConversationEngine)
           - Assess user context and impact
           - Generate UserContext deliverable

        9. Stage Gate 4 Validation
           - Validate user impact assessment

        10. Stage 5: Ethical Risk (with ConversationEngine)
            - Evaluate risks across 5 ethical principles
            - Define mitigation strategies
            - Make governance decision
            - Generate EthicalRiskReport

        11. Stage Gate 5 Validation
            - Final validation of all deliverables

        12. Consistency Check
            - Invoke ConsistencyCheckerAgent
            - Cross-validate all stage data
            - Identify contradictions

        13. Charter Generation
            - Compile all stage deliverables
            - Apply governance decision
            - Generate AIProjectCharter

        14. Session Completion

        - Input sanitization (max lengths enforced)
        - Prompt injection detection

        - Follow-up questions generated for low quality
        - Max 3 attempts before escalation

        - Stage1Agent: 4 question groups, ~12 questions

        - Stage3Agent: Data quality assessment questions
        - Stage4Agent: User impact questions
