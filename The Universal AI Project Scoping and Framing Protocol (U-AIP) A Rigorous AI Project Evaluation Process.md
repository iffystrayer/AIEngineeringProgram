# The Universal AI Project Scoping and Framing Protocol (U-AIP): A Rigorous AI Project Evaluation Process

This document outlines a detailed, step-by-step process for evaluating any Artificial Intelligence (AI) project, derived from the Universal AI Project Scoping and Framing Protocol (U-AIP). This protocol ensures that AI initiatives are strategically aligned, technically feasible, ethically sound, and demonstrably value-driven, minimizing long-term risks and maximizing the probability of successful deployment. This process is designed to be universally applicable across any organization and AI project type.

## OVERVIEW: THE FIVE-STAGE PROTOCOL

The U-AIP mandates a sequential, stage-gated process, ensuring critical assessments are completed *before* significant resources are committed to computationally intensive development. Each stage requires the collection of specific information, the answering of defined questions, and the production of distinct deliverables.
