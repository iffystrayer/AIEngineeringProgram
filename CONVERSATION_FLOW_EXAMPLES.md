# Detailed Conversation Flow Examples
## How Users Interact with the U-AIP Scoping Assistant

**Purpose:** This document shows EXACTLY how users will interact with the system through complete, realistic conversation examples.

**Key Interaction Patterns:**
- CLI-based question-answer sessions
- Real-time quality feedback and clarification requests
- Progress indicators throughout
- Stage-gate validations before progression
- Final charter generation and export

---

## Interface: Command-Line Interactive Session

Users interact through a command-line interface with:
- Text-based Q&A conversation
- Progress bars showing completion status
- Ability to type "help", "save", "pause", or "back" at any time
- Session auto-saves after each completed stage

---

## Example 1: Complete Stage 1 Flow (with Quality Reflection Loop)

This shows a REALISTIC interaction including a vague response that gets rejected and improved.

$ python -m uaip_assistant start
